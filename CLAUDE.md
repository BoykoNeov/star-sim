# Star Simulator — working notes for Claude

Interactive stellar simulator: pick a star's mass & metallicity, watch it evolve
(HR diagram + composition panel + real-time 3D star). Teaching **and** beauty.

**The full spec is `STAR_SIM_SPEC.md` — read it first.** This file is the short
operational layer on top of it; it does not repeat the spec.

## The one rule that overrides everything (spec §3)

Everything the user sees is a function of a single `StellarState`, produced
**only** through the `StellarStateProvider` interface. **No consumer may know
where the state came from.**

- `state.py` / `provider.py` define the boundary. `StellarState` is a plain
  dataclass — keep web/data-source concepts out of it.
- The HR diagram, 3D star, and composition panel consume `StellarState` only.
  A consumer (or the API) that imports a provider's internals — MIST columns,
  file formats, interpolation guts — **is a bug**, not a shortcut.
- Provider swaps happen in exactly one place: `PROVIDER` in `api.py`. Going
  deeper (Stub → MIST → live solver) must change nothing downstream.

## The gotcha that bites everyone (spec §6): interpolate on EEP, not age

Two stars of different mass at the *same age* are in different evolutionary
phases. Interpolating raw tracks against age blends a main-sequence star with a
red giant → physical nonsense. **Always interpolate at fixed EEP** (equivalent
evolutionary point), then map age ↔ EEP. The test for it: an interpolated
intermediate-mass track must lie *between* its neighbors on the HR diagram at
every phase. This matters the moment `MISTProvider` lands; the stub sidesteps it.

## Where things are

- `backend/star_sim/` — `state.py`, `provider.py` (the §3 boundary),
  `providers/mist.py` (the real v1 provider), `providers/stub.py` (data-free
  fallback), `providers/_vendor/read_mist_models.py` (MIST's own parser, §6),
  `fetch_mist.py` (build-time grid fetch), `lane_emden.py` (the Phase 3 §8
  polytrope solver — a **sibling** to the §3 spine, not a provider), `api.py`
  (FastAPI, the swap point; also hosts `/polytrope`, the one route that does NOT
  go through `PROVIDER`).
- `backend/tests/` — §10 sanity checks: `test_mist_provider.py` (Sun anchor,
  ZAMS spread, EEP-between-neighbors, plus the [Fe/H]-axis tests: lies-between
  metallicities, held-out-grid accuracy, dead-corner exclusion),
  `test_stub_provider.py`, and `test_lane_emden.py` (§8 polytrope validation —
  closed forms n=0/1/5 pointwise + Chandrasekhar table; needs no MIST data, so
  always runs). Skip markers in `conftest.py` gate by data present:
  `requires_mist_data` (≥1 grid), `requires_mist_multifeh` (≥2), and
  `requires_mist_heldout_feh` (the m050/p000/p050 trio).
- `frontend/` — static SPA (no bundler): `index.html`, `styles.css`,
  `src/{main,star,hr,comp,lane,color,canvas}.js` (`comp.js` is the §5.4 composition
  panel — a **bulk H/He/metals** view and a Phase 4 **per-element detail** view
  (C·N·O·Ne·Mg·Fe; `mode="cno"` id kept), toggled by `setMode`, the latter with
  independent core/surface scales; `lane.js` is the
  Phase 3 §8 Lane–Emden interior panel — a self-contained
  sibling, driven by the polytropic index `n` alone, that `main.js` instantiates
  but never wires into `refresh()`/`refreshTrack()`; `canvas.js` is the shared
  HiDPI `fitCanvas` helper the HR, composition & Lane–Emden panels all use).
  `star.js` is the Phase 2 §7 shader (a `ShaderMaterial`:
  Teff→color × H_p granulation × limb darkening, streak-proof rotation, + an
  activity-driven corona quad); `color.js` is the reference Planck→CIE→sRGB color
  pipeline (`teffToLinearRGB` for the shader, `teffToRGB`/`teffToCSS` for the 2D
  UI). Three.js via CDN importmap. Served by FastAPI. The pedagogy
  is hover-revealed: a `?` glyph (panel headings, control labels, each readout
  row) and glyph-free dotted-underline hovers on the status-line tokens, all via
  one CSS `data-tip` tooltip. The age window + the snap-tick landmarks are
  derived from the `/track` result itself (single source — the slider domain and
  the composition's EEP span can't drift), not a separate `/age_range` fetch.
- `data/` — downloaded grids (gitignored). Fetch once: `python -m star_sim.fetch_mist`.

## Commands

```bash
# backend (from backend/)
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows; or .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m star_sim.fetch_mist                      # one-time: fetch MIST grids (~180 MB) into data/
uvicorn star_sim.api:app --reload                  # serves API + frontend at :8000
pytest                                             # run sanity tests (MIST tests skip if grids absent)
```

## Current status & what's next

- **Done:** the §3 spine; `MISTProvider` is the live provider (`PROVIDER` in
  `api.py`) — real MIST v2.5 tracks, EEP-fixed **2D (mass × [Fe/H])**
  interpolation over the ZAMS→RGB-tip window. `fetch_mist.py` *discovers* the
  current download URL by scraping MIST's model-grids page (the host moved
  waps.cfa.harvard.edu→mist.science and version v1.2→v2.5 since the spec — §6
  vindicated). `StubProvider` stays as a data-free fallback. The §10 anchors are
  the regression test for the swap (Sun: L≈1.07, Teff≈5834 K at 4.6 Gyr).
- **Done (Phase 1, [Fe/H] axis):** the provider loads N per-metallicity grids
  (currently m050/p000/p050 → [Fe/H] −0.5…+0.5) and does the §6 outer-loop
  metallicity blend. Method: **blend-then-invert** — build the fully (mass,[Fe/H])
  interpolated track window, *then* one age→EEP inversion (consistent with how the
  mass axis already worked; do not "fix" it to per-grid invert). The valid domain
  is **non-rectangular**: super-solar low-mass M-dwarfs have no evolved tracks, so
  `mass_range(feh)` (new provider method + `/mass_range` endpoint) tightens the
  mass floor for [Fe/H]>0; the frontend clamps the mass slider to it. The §10 red
  dwarf survives at solar/sub-solar [Fe/H].
- **Done (Phase 1, composition panel):** the §5.4 panel — stacked-area surface &
  core X/Y/Z vs **EEP** (`comp.js`). EEP not age on the x-axis on purpose: the
  core-H→He transition near TAMS is an invisible sliver on a linear-age axis. Fed
  by a new `track(mass, feh)` provider method + `/track` endpoint returning a list
  of `StellarState` (same §3 dataclass, ordered by EEP — never the raw interp
  window, which would leak provider internals). The same `/track` also draws the HR
  diagram's full-track polyline (§5.2). Track is age-independent: fetched on
  mass/[Fe/H] change (own latest-wins token), the marker moves on age scrub.
  Provider-side, `state_at` and `track` share one `_state_from_row` helper so they
  can't drift (the unchanged Sun anchor proves the refactor).
- **Done (Phase 1, widened window):** the exposed track now runs **ZAMS → end of
  core-He burning (CHeB)**, not just to the RGB tip. `_phase_window` caps at the
  last row before the early-AGB (FSPS `phase >= 4`); `_Track.rgb_end` → `track_end`.
  This adds the He flash + horizontal branch / blue loop — real post-tip drama —
  while stopping short of the AGB thermal pulses (§6's "messy, defer" phases). The
  He flash is *inside* the window but safe: MIST resamples it into strictly-
  increasing-age rows, so the age→EEP inversion never folds. **Consequence to know:**
  the age scrubber's far end is now a red-clump/early-AGB star (~13 R☉), and the
  RGB-tip giant (~154 R☉) is a *mid-track* transient — the tests pull the tip via
  `max(track, key=R)`, not the age-window endpoint. **Documented caveat:** right at
  the He-ignition transition (~2.0–2.1 M☉) cross-mass CHeB interpolation is poor
  even at fine spacing (intrinsic, not grid density — `lies_between` still holds);
  the deferred full grid is the real fix, *not* denser `DEFAULT_MASSES`. New test:
  `test_cheb_interpolation_sampled_by_eep` (samples by EEP, since CHeB is a ~1%
  age-sliver the age-sampled tests miss).
- **Done (Phase 1, full grid + parse cache):** the provider now loads the **full**
  mass grid per metallicity (every track on disk, **0.1…300 M☉** — was a curated
  27-mass `DEFAULT_MASSES` subset), so the mass axis reaches the spec's massive-O-star
  end (§10, ~10⁶ L☉) and the ~2 M☉ He-ignition cliff is **reduced (not eliminated)**
  by tight bracketing (1.9/2.0/2.1 vs the old 1.8/2.0/2.5): measured CHeB median
  L-error ~halves (~23%→~8%) and whole-window median drops <1%, but the steepest CHeB
  rows at the transition stay rough (intrinsic morphology change — `lies_between` still
  holds; `test_transition_mass_interpolation_reduced_not_eliminated` pins it honestly).
  Parsing ~170 text tracks/grid is slow (~20 s), so the windowed
  per-track arrays are cached to a per-grid `_parsed_tracks.npz` (under `data/`,
  gitignored) keyed by a source-file fingerprint (name+size+mtime + `CACHE_VERSION`):
  **62 s cold → 0.35 s warm**. Architecture is **parse-all → cache-all → select
  subset** (`_load_all_tracks`/`_load_grid`): the cache always holds the full grid,
  independent of any `masses=` subset. `DEFAULT_MASSES` survives as an opt-in curated
  constant (the two interpolation tests now pin `masses=(1.4, 1.6)` so 1.5 M☉ stays
  *interpolated* now that it's a real grid point). `fetch_mist` warms the cache after
  download. Storage is pure numeric arrays (concat + `lengths` index, no pickle);
  writes are atomic (temp + `os.replace`). New tests: `test_full_grid_loaded_by_default`,
  `test_parsed_track_cache_roundtrip_fidelity` (bit-for-bit fresh-parse vs cache),
  `test_cache_fingerprint_rejects_stale_source`.
- **Done (Phase 2, shader beauty — frontend-only):** `star.js` is now a
  `ShaderMaterial` and `color.js` the reference color pipeline; **no backend / API
  change, and the `activity` proxy was left untouched** (a §11 open question, not
  Phase 2). Layers (spec §7): **color** = Planck blackbody → CIE 1931 (Wyman CMF
  fit) → linear sRGB, gamma last, max-channel normalized (§10 holds: Sun warm
  near-white, not yellow); **granulation** = animated 3D Worley whose cell
  frequency is the pressure scale height `Q = R·10^logg/Teff` (Sun ≈22 cells,
  clamped [2.5, 90] — the floor *is* the giant's "handful of enormous cells");
  **limb darkening** = quadratic law; **rotation** = a continuous rigid spin
  (latitude-independent → no shear) + a **bounded, per-lifetime-reset** differential
  shear cross-faded across two reforming granule generations — this is the fix for
  the real bug where naive `omega(lat)·t` winds granulation into longitudinal
  **streaks** by ~60 s (don't revert it); **corona** = a camera-facing additive
  quad (a back-shell gave a detached ring) whose intensity+extent scale with
  `activity`, near-glowless for hot O/B stars on purpose, labelled "evocative, not
  predictive" in code + UI. `uTime` comes from a `THREE.Clock` (frame-rate
  independent). Verified with headless Chromium/SwiftShader screenshots (Sun / hot
  15 M☉ / RGB-clump giant / 0.2 M☉ dwarf + a t=0/30/60 s wind-up check); there is
  no JS test harness, so that screenshot pass *is* the regression check.
- **Done (Phase 3, Lane–Emden interior panel — §8):** a live-computed **static
  polytrope** (`P = K ρ^(1+1/n)`), built as a **sibling to the §3 spine, not a
  provider** — the spec is emphatic it is "never the evolution engine," so it is
  **not** a `StellarState` and `/polytrope?n=` is the one route that does **not**
  touch `PROVIDER`. Backend `lane_emden.py` integrates θ″+(2/ξ)θ′=−θⁿ with a
  series start off the ξ=0 singularity, DOP853 (rtol 1e-10), a **terminal event at
  θ=0** for ξ₁, and `f=−max(θ,0)ⁿ` clamping in the RHS (a non-integer power of a
  trial-point negative θ is NaN and would poison the step). Validation is the
  point (§10): closed forms n=0 (√6, 2√6), n=1 (π, π), n=5 (no finite surface)
  checked **pointwise across the domain**, plus both invariants ξ₁ **and**
  −ξ₁²θ′(ξ₁); Chandrasekhar (1939) Table 4 n=1.5/2/3/4 as looser secondary
  cross-checks (recited digits, so a mistyped table value can't impersonate an
  integrator bug). Search cap is **ξ=100** (not 50): ξ₁ diverges as n→5
  (n=4.7→54.8), and a too-small cap would mislabel a real-but-distant surface as
  "no finite surface" — `test_high_n_finite_surface_found_past_old_cap` pins that.
  The no-surface case (n≥5) plots against **raw ξ** out to a readable 20.
  Frontend `lane.js` is **self-contained and decoupled** from the spine: its own
  n-slider (snap presets 0/1/1.5/3/5, each carrying the physics as a *label* —
  n=1.5≈fully convective, n=3≈Eddington/radiative core), own debounced latest-wins
  fetch, never wired into `refresh()`. It plots **ρ/ρc=θⁿ prominently** (the §8
  payoff — central concentration jumps 1→54 from n=0→3) with θ as a fainter line,
  x normalized to r/R=ξ/ξ₁, and a readout of ξ₁, −ξ₁²θ′(ξ₁), and **ρc/ρ̄** (=1
  uniform at n=0, ~54 at n=3). Auto-deriving n from the star was **rejected as
  dishonest** — MIST gives no convective/radiative split, so it would fake a fit;
  n is the user's to set. Verified via headless SwiftShader screenshots
  (n=0/1.5/3/4.7/5); no JS test harness, so that screenshot pass is the regression
  check (the pytest suite is the real gate on the math).
- **Done (Phase 4, per-element CNO composition):** `StellarState` gained
  `metals_surf`/`metals_core` — `dict[str, float]` of element symbol → mass
  fraction (a **breakdown** of the lumped `Z`, not a replacement; X/Y/Z stay).
  Chosen as a **dict, not flat fields**, because the element set is open-ended
  (Fe/Ne/Mg are a one-line add later) and element symbols are a pure physics
  concept, not provider columns (§3). v1 exposes **C, N, O** (the CNO-cycle +
  first-dredge-up payoff), each summed over its isotopes (C=c12+c13,
  N=n13+n14+n15, O=o14…o18) from the MIST `surface_`/`center_` columns. Threaded
  through the whole §6 pipeline: `_Track` arrays Cs/Ns/Os/Cc/Nc/Oc, added to
  `_TRACK_COLS` with **`CACHE_VERSION` 1→2** (old `.npz` rejected → one ~60 s
  reparse), mixed linearly in `_grid_window`/`_blend_windows` (convex → lies-
  between preserved), emitted float-wrapped (JSON-safety) by `_state_from_row`.
  The stub fills a **flat solar-ratio C/N/O split of Z** (no processing →
  surface==core, honest "flavor"). The API is unchanged (`asdict` carries the new
  keys for free; `EXPECTED_KEYS` updated). New §10 tests (the proof): CNO bounds
  (0≤elem≤Z, ΣCNO≤Z), Sun surface solar-ballpark, **first dredge-up** (3 M☉ grid
  point, ZAMS→max-R tip: surface N ×3.15, C ×0.63 — assert N↑/C↓ only, O barely
  moves), core CNO-equilibrium (core N≫surface N, core C≪surface C). **Verified
  the feh-blend path by curl** (all tests use feh=0, which short-circuits the
  blend): off-grid mass×[Fe/H] returns bounded CNO, no KeyError. Frontend:
  `comp.js` has a **bulk ↔ CNO toggle** (`setMode`); the CNO view draws C/N/O as
  lines with **independent core/surface y-scales** — core C/O reach tens of % in
  CHeB while surface stays ~1%, so a shared scale would erase the dredge-up. The
  toggle + swapping legends live in `index.html`/`styles.css`/`main.js`; verified
  via headless SwiftShader screenshots (the screenshot pass is the frontend
  regression check, as in Phases 2–3).
- **Done (Phase 4, widened element set → Ne/Mg/Fe):** the per-element view now
  exposes **six** elements — C, N, O **+ Ne, Mg, Fe** — vindicating the dict design:
  `state.py` was untouched (open-ended `metals_surf`/`metals_core`). Provider
  threading mirrors the CNO add: `_Track` gained `Nes/Mgs/Fes` + `Nec/Mgc/Fec`
  (Ne=ne18…ne22, Mg=mg23…mg26, **Fe=fe56**, a single isotope), `_TRACK_COLS` +
  **`CACHE_VERSION` 2→3** (old `.npz` rejected → one ~60 s reparse), linear mixing in
  `_grid_window`/`_blend_windows`, six entries each in `_state_from_row`'s dicts. The
  stub's `CNO_OF_Z` became `METALS_OF_Z` (added Ne 0.112 / Mg 0.047 / Fe 0.085, solar
  fractions-of-Z; the six sum to ~0.82 Z so the per-element sum stays under Z). **The
  physics caught a wrong assumption** (advisor): Fe is *not* flat on the MS — MIST
  models gravitational settling, so the **Sun's surface Fe dips ~10% ZAMS→4.6 Gyr**
  (measured ×0.90). So the "inert tracer" test is at **3 M☉** (diffusion suppressed:
  Fe ×1.00, Ne ×0.99, Mg ×1.00 while N ×3.15) and asserts a *relative* bound, not
  flatness. Fe doubles as the **[Fe/H]-axis validator**: surface Fe at ZAMS scales
  ~10^Δ[Fe/H] per grid (measured Fe(+0.5)/Fe(0)=2.85, Fe(0)/Fe(−0.5)=3.05 vs 3.16 —
  a touch under, since [Fe/H] is a number ratio vs H; `rel=0.20`, multifeh-gated).
  New/updated §10 tests: `test_metal_breakdown_present_and_bounded` (set is the six,
  sum≤Z margin ~1e-3), `test_heavy_tracers_inert_while_cno_processes`,
  `test_iron_validates_the_feh_axis`; stub `test_stub_metal_breakdown_bounded`.
  Verified the full mass×[Fe/H] blend path via live API curl (off-grid 2.7 M☉ /
  [Fe/H]=0.25 → six bounded keys, no KeyError; all 505 track rows carry the same
  keyset). Frontend: `comp.js` `ELEMS`/`ELEM_COL` → six (atomic-number order; Fe a
  steel-grey iron mnemonic); the drawing loop was already generic. Legend grew 3→6
  (flex-wraps), button "C·N·O detail" → "per-element detail", **both** comp tooltips
  (panel `<h2>` + mode help) updated; internal `mode="cno"` id kept (minimal churn).
  Verified via headless Chrome screenshot of a throwaway probe rendering real 3 M☉
  `/track` data in cno mode (six distinct lines, dredge-up visible, scales intact).
- **Done (Phase 4, early-AGB extension):** the exposed window now runs **ZAMS → end
  of the early-AGB (EAGB, phase 4)** — the second giant ascent — not just to CHeB.
  One-line change at the §6 gate: `_phase_window` threshold `phase >= 4` → `>= 5`
  (`track_end` ~705 → ~806); **`CACHE_VERSION` 3→4** (track_end is cached; old caches
  hold the narrower value → one ~60 s reparse, arrays unchanged). The decision was
  **data-driven, not assumed** (4 throwaway probes + advisor): across the full grid
  the phase-4 onset is the *same* EEP row (~706) for every mass with a real AGB
  (EEP-aligned like CHeB), age stays strictly increasing (inversion never folds), and
  EAGB is smooth (2–4 logL/logR reversals/track) — vs the **TPAGB (phase 5) we
  hard-stop before**: 30–100 reversals/track (thermal pulses survive resampling, at
  different EEP rows per mass → cross-mass interp blends incoherent pulses, the §6
  "messy, defer"), and MIST v2.5's third dredge-up is too weak to even deliver the
  carbon-star payoff (surface C/O stays ~0.3). **Consequence to know:** the age
  scrubber's far end is now a luminous, low-gravity EAGB giant (R up to a few hundred
  R☉, logg ~0.6–1.2 — the §7 enormous-granule payoff), and for **intermediate masses
  EAGB radius can exceed the RGB tip**, so tests (and the frontend "RGB tip" landmark)
  now pull the first-ascent tip from **`phase=="RGB"` rows**, not the global max-R
  (the dredge-up anchors are unchanged: N ×3.14, C ×0.63 at the RGB tip). **Two
  honesty notes (advisor):** (a) the `"EAGB"` label is *nominal* for ~15–40 M☉ (MIST
  tags phase-4 pre-collapse supergiant rows there, no literal AGB) — we report
  MIST/FSPS's code faithfully rather than mass-relabel; massive stars >~8 M☉ have a
  *zero-width* phase 4 so their window is untouched. (b) the 6.5→7 M☉ boundary is
  where the *TPAGB* disappears, but EAGB survives both sides → interpolating across it
  is accurate (measured ~0.6% median L-error for held-out 6.5). New §10 tests:
  `test_eagb_extends_window_and_tpagb_is_excluded` (the scope proof — EAGB present,
  TPAGB/post-AGB never), `test_eagb_interpolation_sampled_by_eep` (1.5 from 1.4/1.6,
  EEP-sampled like the CHeB test), `test_eagb_interpolation_across_tpagb_boundary`
  (the advisor-insisted cross-mass accuracy check at the boundary). Frontend (pure
  pedagogy + one landmark fix): `PHASE_TIP.EAGB` gloss, Phase-readout + age-slider
  tooltip text, `criticalAges` RGB-tip restricted to RGB rows. Verified end-to-end via
  live API curl + a headless Chromium screenshot (3 M☉ at max age → EAGB giant
  renders, status line "EAGB", no JS errors). 63 tests pass (was 60).
- **Next:** more Phase 4 paths, each behind the existing §3 provider interface:
  more elements still (Si/S/Ca/Ti — same one-line dict add; would shrink the
  sum-under-Z headroom further), `MESAProvider` (offline MESA history/profile files
  via `mesa_reader`), the **TPAGB thermal pulses** (still deferred — §6's genuinely
  messy phase; would need explicit per-grid handling, *not* cross-mass interpolation),
  eventually a `LiveSolverProvider` or reduced nuclear network (large, explicitly out
  of scope for now — see spec §9).

## Conventions

- Keep the stub honest: it is physically *flavored*, not a model. Label
  approximations in comments (the corona/activity layer is "evocative, not
  predictive" per spec §7).
- Don't let scope creep in: no live structure solve, no nuclear network, no
  deploy/bundle concerns (spec §2). This runs locally.
