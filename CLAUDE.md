# Star Simulator — working notes for Claude

Interactive stellar simulator: pick a star's mass & metallicity, watch it evolve
(HR diagram + composition panel + real-time 3D star). Teaching **and** beauty.

**The full spec is `STAR_SIM_SPEC.md` — read it first.** This file is the short
operational layer on top of it; it does not repeat the spec.

## The one rule that overrides everything (spec §3)

Everything the user sees is a function of a single `StellarState`, produced
**only** through the `StellarStateProvider` interface. **No consumer may know
where the state came from.**

- `state.py` / `provider.py` define the boundary. `StellarState` is a plain
  dataclass — keep web/data-source concepts out of it.
- The HR diagram, 3D star, and composition panel consume `StellarState` only.
  A consumer (or the API) that imports a provider's internals — MIST columns,
  file formats, interpolation guts — **is a bug**, not a shortcut.
- Provider swaps happen in exactly one place: `PROVIDER` in `api.py`. Going
  deeper (Stub → MIST → live solver) must change nothing downstream.

## The gotcha that bites everyone (spec §6): interpolate on EEP, not age

Two stars of different mass at the *same age* are in different evolutionary
phases. Interpolating raw tracks against age blends a main-sequence star with a
red giant → physical nonsense. **Always interpolate at fixed EEP** (equivalent
evolutionary point), then map age ↔ EEP. The test for it: an interpolated
intermediate-mass track must lie *between* its neighbors on the HR diagram at
every phase. This matters the moment `MISTProvider` lands; the stub sidesteps it.

## Where things are

- `backend/star_sim/` — `state.py`, `provider.py` (the §3 boundary),
  `providers/mist.py` (the real v1 provider), `providers/mesa.py` (the **second**
  real provider — offline MESA `history.data`, a different on-disk format behind
  the same boundary; **multi-metallicity by snapping** — `[Fe/H]` buckets, snap
  feh-then-mass, no cross-mass/cross-feh interp; used to **validate MIST**),
  `providers/stub.py` (data-free fallback),
  `providers/_vendor/read_mist_models.py` (MIST's own parser, §6),
  `fetch_mist.py` / `fetch_mesa.py` (build-time grid fetches), `lane_emden.py`
  (the Phase 3 §8 polytrope solver — a **sibling** to the §3 spine, not a
  provider), `spectra.py` (the Phase 5 synthetic-spectrum runtime — also a
  sibling), `bpass.py` (the **first ENSEMBLE sibling** behind `/population` — a whole
  coeval population's integrated spectrum, single-star vs. +binaries, from a BPASS SSP
  bake; pure numpy/stdlib, imports NOT even `StellarState`, never a provider),
  `structure.py` (the **real interior-structure** sibling — offline MESA
  radial `profile.data` snapshots behind `/structure`; the honest successor to
  Lane–Emden, its own MESA-profile parser, snaps (mass,[Fe/H],age) to the nearest
  saved snapshot, never imports a provider), `binary.py` (the **binary-stripped-star**
  sibling behind `/binary` — the hot He-star a companion strips, Götberg 2018; its own
  CSV parser over the *committed* `star_sim/data/gotberg_z014.csv`, snaps (Z,Minit),
  never imports a provider — the ~70% WR channel; also carries path (b): `/binary_pair`
  composes the donor + a PROVIDER companion, and `roche_geometry()` computes the pure
  RLOF-moment Roche-lobe geometry from the CSV's `P_init` column), `api.py` (FastAPI, the
  swap point; also hosts `/polytrope`, `/structure`, `/spectrum`, `/binary` and
  `/binary_pair`, the routes that do NOT go through `PROVIDER`).
- `backend/tests/` — §10 sanity checks: `test_mist_provider.py` (Sun anchor,
  ZAMS spread, EEP-between-neighbors, plus the [Fe/H]-axis tests: lies-between
  metallicities, held-out-grid accuracy, dead-corner exclusion),
  `test_mesa_provider.py`, `test_mesa_vs_mist.py` (the **measured** MESA-vs-MIST
  cross-validation, matched on Z + central-Xc via the public `track()` API),
  `test_stub_provider.py`, `test_lane_emden.py` (§8 polytrope validation),
  `test_spectra.py`, `test_endgame.py`, `test_structure.py` (the real MESA
  interior-structure sibling — convective-envelope-over-radiative-core, order-of-SSM
  central values, monotone centrally-concentrated ρ, canonical-polytrope overlay,
  honest snapping). Skip markers in `conftest.py` gate by data present
  (`requires_mist_data`, `requires_mist_multifeh`, `requires_mist_heldout_feh`,
  `requires_mesa_data`, `requires_mist_lowz`, `requires_spectra_data`,
  `requires_structure_data`, …).
- `frontend/` — static SPA (no bundler): `index.html`, `styles.css`,
  `src/{main,star,hr,comp,lane,structure,roche,spectrum,sed,scale,classify,color,canvas,layout,tooltip,sn}.js`.
  `roche.js` is the binary path-(b) Chunk-3 **mass-transfer / Roche-lobe** panel (a pushed-data consumer
  drawing the RLOF-moment orbital-plane figure-of-eight from `/binary_pair`'s `roche` block; shown only in
  `body.stripped-mode.companion-on`).
  `sn.js` is the SN endgame's cited observed-photometry dataset (SN 1987A ⁵⁶Co tail +
  SN 1999em IIP plateau, published bolometric fits — the Tier-1 overlay anchor); `hr.js`
  gains a `setSupernova()` light-curve view (L vs **linear** days → the straight ⁵⁶Co tail),
  a **Teff-colored living track** + glowing marker (one shared `drawMarker`), a
  **past/future split at the marker** (traversed solid, ahead dim — living AND endgame
  tracks, `splitIndex` = marker array identity + age fallback), faint
  **O·B·A·F·G·K·M spectral-class bands** (letters above the top frame line, living view
  only), and dotted **iso-radius diagonals** (constant-R graph paper from L=4πR²σT⁴,
  living AND endgame views — the WD cooling track slides down one; never the SN light
  curve — see [[star-sim-frontend-ux]]); plus a **coeval-population number-density overlay**
  (`setPopulationHRD`, BPASS Chunk 2 — a translucent cell heatmap of stars/1e6M☉ per
  (logTeff, logL) cell in the LIVING view only, behind the track: MAGENTA where binaries
  populate cells single-star evolution leaves empty (blue stragglers, stripped-He), faint
  cyan where in both; the HR-panel twin of the SED wedge, driven by the shared
  `#population-toggle` — see [[star-sim-coeval-ensemble-bpass]]).
  `layout.js` is the draggable/responsive **dashboard** layer (a reorder-in-flow
  sortable over the flex-wrap panel container, see [[star-sim-draggable-responsive-panels]]).
  `comp.js` is the §5.4 composition panel — **three** views via `setMode` (bulk
  H/He/Z; per-element detail, 14 metals + linear/log `setScale`, `mode="cno"` id
  kept; light-element `mode="light"` Li/Be/F log-forced). `lane.js` is the Phase 3
  §8 Lane–Emden interior panel (a self-contained sibling driven by the polytropic
  index `n` alone, never wired into `refresh()`). `structure.js` is its **honest
  successor** — the real MESA interior-structure panel: a live consumer wired into
  `paintState` that fetches `/structure` for the marker's (mass,[Fe/H],age), draws
  ρ(r)/T(r)/X(r) center-normalized vs r/R + shaded convective zones + the two
  canonical polytrope overlays (n=1.5/3, references, not fitted), and labels the
  nearest saved snapshot (jumps between snapshots; snapped-far note when off-grid).
  `star.js` is the Phase 2 §7
  shader (Teff→color × H_p granulation × **chromatic** limb darkening (blue darkens
  most — the limb warms) × Teff-keyed **exposure** (cool = deep/saturated, hot =
  clipped blue-white, Sun anchored at 1.0) × streak-proof rotation + activity corona
  quad (monotone outside-the-limb profile — never a rim ring) + a Teff×L-keyed
  **glare** quad (hot luminous objects blaze; SN re-keys it to the light curve) +
  an opt-in **Ap/Bp chemical-peculiarity** what-if (`uPeculiar` + `peculiarSpots()`: co-
  rotating oblique-dipole abundance spots, a brightness-only dip, EVOCATIVE like the corona;
  a `#peculiar-toggle` track-stable on the A/B mass regime, faded per-state outside the
  A/B-MS Teff window; composes with gravity darkening — see [[star-sim-apbp-peculiarity]]) —
  see [[star-sim-phase2-shaders]] for the rework) + a **deterministic static starfield
  backdrop** (seeded, a flat far sheet NOT a shell; pure backdrop, encodes no state —
  see [[star-sim-frontend-ux]]). `color.js` is the reference
  Planck→CIE→sRGB color pipeline
  (`teffToLinearRGB` for the shader, `teffToRGB`/`teffToCSS`/`wavelengthToCSS` for
  the 2D UI). `canvas.js` is the shared HiDPI `fitCanvas` helper. Three.js via CDN
  importmap, served by FastAPI. Pedagogy is hover-revealed (a `?` glyph + dotted
  status-line tokens, all via one `tooltip.js` singleton). The age window + snap-tick
  landmarks are derived from the `/track` result itself (single source), not a
  separate `/age_range` fetch.
- `data/` — downloaded grids (gitignored). Fetch once: `python -m star_sim.fetch_mist`.

## Current status & what's next

Phases 1–5 are built; the app is feature-complete for the current scope. This is
**current state**, not a changelog — the full per-feature history lives in git, the
`docs/memory/` topic files (detailed, recalled on demand), and `docs/plans/`
(designs). The `[[links]]` below point at the topic file that holds the detail.

### Providers (the §3 spine)
- `PROVIDER` in `api.py` is **`MISTProvider`** — the live provider. Real MIST v2.5
  tracks, EEP-fixed **2D (mass × [Fe/H])** interpolation (blend-then-invert), full
  mass grid **0.1–300 M☉** per metallicity, window **ZAMS → end of early-AGB** (the
  LIVING track hard-stops at φ5 per §6 "messy, defer" — but the TPAGB thermal-pulse rows
  are NOT lost: `endgame()` snaps to one real track and exposes them, and they ship two ways
  — the WD gateway's cooling scrub (loops compressed to 12%, `WD_FP`) AND an opt-in
  **thermal-pulse showcase** that decompresses the He-shell-flash sawtooth to the full HR
  panel, gated on a data-derived amplitude floor). Non-rectangular valid
  domain (`mass_range(feh)` tightens the floor for [Fe/H]>0). Per-grid
  `_parsed_tracks.npz` parse cache (**`CACHE_VERSION` 11**; ~50–110 s cold reparse on
  a bump, ~0.35 s warm). A **third selection axis — rotation `vvcrit`** — is on the
  boundary and **wired end-to-end (rotation Chunks 1–4 DONE — arc complete)**: grids partition into one
  `_Axis` per rotation rate keyed by `(feh, vvcrit)`, the provider **snaps** between
  buckets (MIST ships only {0.0, 0.4}, no third grid to blend) and interpolates
  mass×[Fe/H] *within* a bucket. `track()/state_at()/endgame()/mass_range()/age_range()`
  take `vvcrit=0.0` (default = non-rotating, so the live spine is byte-unchanged) and the
  API exposes it as a query param + a `/rotation_status` route (the data-derived honesty
  gate). Rotation is **mass-ramped at the ~1.2 M☉ Kraft break** (bit-identical below it).
  `surf_avg_v_rot` is now surfaced as the real **`v_rot_kms`** (0 non-rotating/below the
  break, real above). Frontend: a **unified "Rotation" control** below [Fe/H] with two
  regime-gated facets — the vvcrit **track** toggle (massive, gated by `rotation_status`)
  + the rotation-**period** slider (cool-MS activity, the SED slider relocated here, gated
  by the dynamo domain). **Chunk 4 (data) done**: m075/m050/p050 vvcrit0.4 fetched, so the
  rotating axis spans the **full [Fe/H] axis −1.0→+0.5** (coextensive with non-rotating);
  `rotation_status.has_grid` honest across it. [[star-sim-rotation-subpop-atlas]], [[star-sim-mist-provider]],
  [[star-sim-composition-panel]], [[star-sim-nonthermal-sed-plan]].
- `MESAProvider` — the **second real provider** (offline MESA `history.data`, a
  different on-disk format behind the same boundary), used to **validate MIST**.
  Discrete-grid, snap-to-nearest, **multi-metallicity by snapping** (no
  cross-mass/feh interp). Two Z buckets on disk: bearums [Fe/H]≈−0.84
  (1/2/4/6/10/14/20 M☉) + a self-run solar Z=0.0152 bucket (1/2/6 M☉, Docker MESA
  r24.03.1). Payoff = **measured** MESA-vs-MIST cross-validation matched on Z +
  central-Xc. **Opt-in** (not the live PROVIDER). [[star-sim-phase4-mesa]]; recipe
  `backend/docs/mesa_solar_recipe.md`.
- `StubProvider` — data-free fallback, physically *flavored* not modeled.

### Composition (§5.4 panel)
- `StellarState` carries `metals_surf`/`metals_core` **dicts** (a breakdown of Z,
  not flat fields — `state.py` was untouched across every element add). Per-element
  set is **sixteen**: Li·Be·C·N·O·F·Ne·Na·Mg·Al·Si·P·S·Ca·Ti·Fe (sum ~0.99 Z).
  Adding more individual metals is a dead end for payoff (Na/Al/P are invisible
  floor-huggers; Cr/Mn/Ni aren't in MIST v2.5's network; boron's only isotope is
  radioactive b8). [[star-sim-phase4-cno]].

### Spectra (synthetic-spectrum panel — a **sibling**, not a provider)
- `/spectrum` bypasses `PROVIDER` (like `/polytrope`). Engine = MSG/pymsg
  **build-time bake** → void-filled flux cube `data/spectra/spectra_grid.npz`
  (gitignored) → pure-Python scipy runtime `spectra.py`. Current cube: 3-grid Teff
  axis **2300–55000 K**, **142×12×11×2400** (Göttingen cool <3500 + CAP18
  Teff/[Fe/H]/logg + OSTAR2002 hot >30000). The bake is axis-generic (single→
  multi-grid via `--cool-grid`/`--hot-grid`, **no `BAKE_VERSION` bump**). Payoffs:
  [Fe/H] deepens metal lines; He I/II `minTeff`-gated; TiO `maxTeff`-gated;
  past-ceiling no-model notice keyed off `teff_max`. **v sin i line broadening** (the
  rotation-axis spectral follow-on, `spectrum.js` only): a client-side convolution with
  Gray's rotation profile (ε=0.6, per-pixel width Δλ_L=λ·v sin i/c, EW-conserving),
  driven by the marker's real `v_rot_kms` **edge-on** (sin i=1, the max projection — no
  inclination slider, it'd be incoherent with no oblateness model); scoped to the main
  absorption cube (WD/WR/SN exempt), no refetch, caption gated ≥120 km/s (the ~1-px
  R≈2400 floor). Backend byte-unchanged. [[star-sim-phase5-spectra]],
  [[star-sim-rotation-subpop-atlas]]; recipe `backend/docs/msg_spectra_build_recipe.md`;
  plan `docs/plans/graceful-toasting-thimble.md`.

### Endgame (WR/WD — `/endgame` goes **through** PROVIDER; an endgame state IS a StellarState)
- Both endgames are already on disk in the MIST tracks (clipped by the `phase>=5`
  window). `endgame()` is on the Protocol (MESA/Stub → `type="none"`),
  `EndgameResult` dataclass, snaps both mass+feh, data-derived classify (φ9→WR /
  φ6-or-logg>7→WD / **evolved-massive→SN** [reached CHeB φ≥3 AND final mass > 1.4 M☉
  Chandrasekhar] / else none). The SN test was once a row-count artifact (`r0≤r_last`,
  "has a post-window row") that silently dropped massive ROTATING & very-massive-metal-
  poor stars into "none" → the gateway said *nothing* for stars that core-collapse;
  fixed to classify by the evolved/massive end state (the Chandrasekhar floor keeps a
  low-mass blue-HB star ending at CHeB from being mislabelled SN). WD path = a reversible gateway button
  at the slider limit → log-cooling-age scrubber + WD 3D shader + structure panel +
  mass–radius re-snap. WR path (Chunk 4) = the matching `→ Continue: Wolf–Rayet` button
  → reversible `wr-mode`: index-linear scrub over the φ9 sub-track (WN→WC→WO landmark),
  HR axes to ~316 kK / logL 7, the **normal comp views** (the stripped surface IS the
  story — no custom cross-section), WN/WC/WO subtype from surface composition, mass-stays-
  live re-snap, end caption narrates the un-modeled core-collapse. WR 3D (Chunk 5) = the
  **optically-thick-wind shader** (`star.js` `WIND_FRAG` + `wind` mesh): an additive halo
  over the opaque hot sphere — electron-scattering haze brightest at the limb (pseudo-
  photosphere) + outward-advected value-noise filaments; reach/density read from `Z_surf`
  (smooth WN → clumpy WC/WO), color = honest Teff blackbody (no chemistry hue — it'd
  contradict the spectrum placeholder), intensity a gentle clamped `L` tie (NOT a measured
  Ṁ). **Fit-to-frame extent** (`applyWindScale`, recomputed each frame) — the WR scrub opens
  on a huge R≈33 R☉ star, so a constant extent would clip the viewport. WD spectra (Chunk
  **6a**) = a **second** spectrum sibling `/wd_spectrum`: a separate rectangular Koester DA
  cube (82 Teff × 13 log g, pure-H so no [Fe/H], host-baked — no Docker/pymsg via
  `fetch_koester.py` + `scripts/bake_wd_spectra.py`), `spectrum.js` `updateWD` switched in by
  surface gravity (`refreshWD`: log g ≥ 6.0 **or Teff > 55 kK** = the main cube's OSTAR
  ceiling → WD cube, else main cube, so TPAGB-giant rows show their real spectrum and the
  contracting ~55–80 kK rise routes to the WD cube too — no "no model" flash). **DC** Planck
  continuum below the ~5000 K floor
  (no Balmer painted on a cold cinder). WD spectra (Chunk **6b**) = the **TMAP** NLTE hot
  splice: `fetch_tmap.py` (SVO `tmap` H-rich Hemass=0 slab, 72 models) → `bake_wd_spectra.py
  --tmap-dir` splices the >80 kK nodes onto the hot end of the SAME WD cube (now 93 Teff ×
  13 log g, `koester2-DA+TMAP-CSPN`), so the ~100–190 kK post-AGB **central star** shows a
  real spectrum (`regime="CSPN"`, weak Balmer on a steep blue continuum) where the old
  no-model frame was; residual no-model re-pointed at TMAP's 190 kK ceiling (only ~300–400 kK
  massive-progenitor central stars). Measured: **no ×π×10⁸** (SVO ascii is physical; seam
  ratio 1.005–1.021 → no rescale), log-linear blue-gap fill (TMAP starts 3200 Å), log g-clamp
  honest (optical Δ 0.03 vs 0.41 for a cooling DA), **no `BAKE_VERSION` bump** (OSTAR-splice
  precedent). WR spectra (Chunk **7**, the last chunk) = a **third** spectrum sibling
  `/wr_spectrum` over the **PoWR** wind-emission grids, keyed on the WR axes **(T\*, Rt)** not
  (Teff, log g) — `fetch_powr.py` (per-grid tarballs, host-only) → `bake_wr_spectra.py`
  (**flat-node** cube, NOT rectangular void-fill — the (T\*, Rt) footprint is a ragged
  parallelogram with an empty hot+dense-wind corner) → `spectra.py` `wr_spectrum_data` →
  `spectrum.js` `updateWR` (an **emission** draw: continuum-normalized so lines stand UP,
  WR species guides). **Narrow-GO, measured first (the 7a gate):** mapping real MIST WR states
  (**T\*≈Teff**, **Rt** from a Nugis–Lamers Ṁ — `star_mdot` stays OFF StellarState) shows PoWR
  covers only the cool, H-rich **WNh entry** (~10%); the stripped core is the hot, compact
  *evolutionary* surface (Teff 150–262 kK ≈ T\*, far hotter/denser-wind than any *observed* WR
  — the evolutionary-vs-spectroscopic Teff gap), so the bulk shows an honest **no-model** frame.
  Snaps to nearest node (subtype WNE/WNL/WC from surface composition, metallicity gal/lmc/smc
  from [Fe/H]). **Chunks 1–7 ALL BUILT — the WR/WD endgame arc is complete.**
  [[star-sim-wr-wd-endgame-plan]]; plan `docs/plans/smoldering-cinder-gateway.md`, spectra
  recipe `backend/docs/msg_spectra_build_recipe.md §7a/§8/§8b/§9`.

### Supernova (core-collapse — fills the dead `type="SN"` branch; a **hybrid sibling**, not on the tracks)
- The third fate. Unlike WD/WR (already on the MIST tracks), a supernova is a **computed
  semi-analytic model** — the tracks end at collapse — so it's a **sibling** (`supernova.py`,
  like `lane_emden`/`spectra`), with classification + progenitor scalars staying on the spine.
  **Chunk 1 BUILT (backend vertical, no frontend):** `EndgameResult` gained the SN-branch-only
  scalars `pre_sn_radius_rsun`/`he_core_msun`/`co_core_msun`/`h_retained` (`None` for WD/WR/none
  and for Stub/MESA); `CACHE_VERSION` **11→12** parses `he_core_mass`/`c_core_mass`/`o_core_mass`
  (the **Mcur pattern** — cached, read off the snapped track, never blended). **R₀ = max radius
  over the final-phase rows EXCLUDING the terminal EEP row** (the open calibration knob, settled:
  the low-g terminal artifact can spuriously inflate *or* shrink R; max beats the median, which
  underestimates). `supernova.py` is a **pure sibling** (imports only `state.StellarState`,
  never the provider): a frozen `Progenitor` input (the route builds it from the EndgameResult),
  `supernova_model(progenitor, m_ni, e_kin)` → a `SupernovaModel` (light curve
  **`w·L_p·rise + (1−w)·L_radio`** — the blend kills the t=0 ⁵⁶Ni deposition spike a `max()`
  would surface — + homologous photosphere `StellarState`s `R=v·t`, Teff from Stefan-Boltzmann,
  `logg` honestly negative). NS/BH from a labeled CO-core cut, `M_ej = final − remnant`;
  no-plateau radioactive-only fallback for compact R₀<300 low-Z progenitors. `/supernova`
  bypasses `PROVIDER` for the compute but calls `PROVIDER.endgame()` for the progenitor; a
  non-SN progenitor → `is_supernova:false`, real fate echoed, no curve. **3-tier honesty:** Tier-1
  ⁵⁶Co tail slope (bulletproof) · Tier-2 plateau shape from MIST M_ej/R₀ (±dex level) · Tier-3
  peak/tail ∝ M_Ni (a **free slider**). **Two advisor test corrections, measurement-validated:**
  the Tier-3 test scales the radioactive **tail** not the peak (the IIP peak IS the M_Ni-free
  plateau `L_p`); the Tier-1 Co-slope is measured on the served **`L_radio` component** (0.00976)
  — on `L_total` the plateau cutoff bleeds in and steepens it to 0.01023. Measured canonical 15 M☉:
  plateau 1.83e42/138.7 d. **Chunk 2 BUILT (frontend gateway + light-curve panel):** a reversible
  `sn-mode` mirroring WD/WR — the dead SN note becomes a `→ Continue: Supernova` gateway button
  (enabled at end-of-life, still foreshadowed from ZAMS), the HR panel CSS-swaps its title to
  **Supernova light curve** and `hr.setSupernova()` redraws it as **L vs LINEAR days** (the straight
  ⁵⁶Co tail — a log-time axis would bend it), the age slider becomes a **linear-days time scrubber**
  (`snStateIndex` → nearest homologous state), the ⁵⁶Ni-mass **`sn-control` slider** (Tier-3, 0.001–0.3,
  debounced refetch) lifts the **tail not the plateau**, and the new **cited observed-photometry
  overlays** (`sn.js` — SN 1987A ⁵⁶Co tail + SN 1999em IIP plateau, **published bolometric fits, not raw
  photometry**, cited in a visible `.hr-sn-caption`) are the deferred **Tier-1 anchor**. Consumers
  (3D/SED/comp/scale/readout/classify) get the photosphere StellarState via an explicit `{endgame:"sn"}`
  signal (NOT naive reuse — `logg≈−5` ejecta would trip the boiling-fireball gate); `star.js` shows a
  smooth glowing sphere (granulation/corona off), `comp.js`/`spectrum.js` honest
  placeholders, entry narrates the un-modeled bounce. Mass/[Fe/H] stay live → re-snap (`trySNResnap`;
  WD/WR/none revert with a note). Playwright-verified at 1440 + 390 px (zero console errors), 215 pytest
  (backend untouched). **Chunk 3 BUILT (3D expanding fireball → remnant, frontend-only):** `star.js`
  gained `FIREBALL_FRAG` (a dedicated additive `fireball` sphere mesh, reuses `star.geometry`) + `REMNANT_FRAG`
  (a small camera-facing additive dot). In SN mode the surface sphere hides (`star.visible=!sn`, set
  **unconditionally**) and the fireball shows: 3D value-noise fbm on a bounded time orbit (boils, no drift/seam),
  center-bright, color = the **honest blackbody Teff** (the one load-bearing cue — blue-white→orange→red IS the
  cooling); a single additive layer with clamped alpha keeps the hue + cell structure (no white-out). `refreshSN`
  drives `snGrow` (swells the ball over the early scrub — the evocative "expanding" beat, true AU-scale R on the
  scale bar) + `snFade` (dissipates it over the late tail), threaded `{endgame:"sn", remnant, snGrow, snFade}`.
  As `snFade`→1 the remnant emerges: **NS** → a tiny hot blue-white dot (color labeled **evocative, NOT a Teff** —
  a real NS's optical thermal emission is negligible); **BH/failed** → no dot, the frame goes dark ("**winks out**").
  Measured: a BH-on-SN progenitor IS in-grid (**30 M☉ solar** → BH vs **15 M☉ solar** NS), so winks-out isn't dead
  code — both verified on-screen. **Chunk 4 BUILT (pre-collapse onion shell, frontend-only):** `comp.js` `drawSNOnion`
  replaces the SN placeholder with the progenitor's onion cross-section, driven by the scalars `/supernova` already
  serves (`final/he/CO/remnant` masses + ⁵⁶Ni — **no backend change**). Real boundaries (remnant/CO/He/total) sized by
  **area ∝ enclosed mass** (radius ∝ √(M/M_tot)); the inner Si/O–Ne shells are **faint schematic** dividers (MIST v2.5
  runs massive stars only to ~carbon burning, so `c_core_mass` is the *last computed* boundary — the iron core is never
  built; the caption owns it, the boron-b8 discipline); **NS/BH contrast honest** (a BH's remnant = the whole CO core →
  the onion visibly LACKS the copper C/O+heavy band, only He+H eject); ⁵⁶Ni an **exaggerated** slider-tied ring (not to
  scale, kept on BH too — consistent with the light curve). Static across the time scrub (`comp.update` no-op in SN mode),
  redraws on the ⁵⁶Ni-slider / mass-re-snap (both verified live: 0.06→0.25, NS↔BH). Phone-width label-overflow bug caught
  + fixed (even-spacing fit, caveats fold into the always-shown caption). **Chunk 5 BUILT (remnant branch NS/BH/failed-SN
  + cliff softening; backend + frontend — the SN arc is COMPLETE):** the hard CO=7 NS/BH cut became a **labeled fallback
  continuum** `φ=smoothstep(CO_NS_MAX=7, CO_DIRECT=12, co_core)` that softens the old cliff in the light curve AND the
  onion in one stroke — the remnant grows `M_NS+(M_final−M_NS)·φ`, the ejecta `M_ej=M_final−M_remnant` shrink smoothly
  to ~0, and the **ejected** ⁵⁶Ni `=M_Ni·(1−φ)` dims (deepest ash falls back first); new served fields `fallback_fraction`/
  `failed_sn`/`m_ni_ejected_msun`. **Two advisor blockers, fixed:** (1) the **NS↔BH label flips where the remnant crosses
  NS_MAX~2.5 M☉, NOT at CO=7** (else a near-threshold "BH" sits in the observed mass gap and reads as a bug) — so **30 M☉
  solar (CO 7.68) is now a heavy NS ~2.16, not a BH**; new demos BH-fallback 40 M☉/[Fe/H]−0.5, failed 50 M☉/[Fe/H]−1.0;
  (2) a **failed SN does NOT reuse the homologous photosphere** (`v=√(2E/M_ej)` blows up, ejected Ni→0 → log(0)) — its
  states stay at R₀ and DIM, the "disappearing supergiant", and the served curve uses a tiny floored Ni (positive, ~3 dex
  below a real IIP). **3D reconciled** (a Chunk-3 inconsistency — Chunk 3 made *all* BH wink out): NS→fireball+dot,
  **BH-fallback→fireball→dark invisible remnant (no dot, not a wink-out)**, **failed→dim→black (winks out)**. Onion drops
  the rem≤CO clamp (remnant eats C/O→He→H, no cliff), ring uses ejected Ni, failed onion ≈ all void + winks-out caption;
  `hr.js` violet failed-SN banner; readout "% fell back" + "direct collapse"; classify/SED branch on `failed`. 220 pytest,

### Binary-stripped stars (the ~70% WR channel — a **sibling**, not a provider; `/binary` bypasses PROVIDER)
- **CE/COMPACT-OBJECT TAIL — CHUNKS 1a (backend) & 1b (frontend render) & 1c (full 8-bucket
  [Fe/H] axis + free M_star/M_co/P custom sliders) ALL BUILT** (Phase 1 of
  `docs/plans/tempered-lineage-inspiral.md`; a compact object NS/BH/WD orbiting a still-H-rich
  star — the stage AFTER the HMS-HMS episode, the ~X-ray-binary/GW-progenitor channel). A
  genuinely new sibling `posydon_co.py` + `/co_binary_track` (schema recon: `history2` is absent
  grid-wide, so there's only ever ONE real star — not a `posydon.py` branch). **Chunk 1b** is a
  **standalone curated demo** inside stripped-mode (its own `.co-binary-view` body class, mutually
  exclusive with the HMS-HMS `.binary-view` — each hides the other's demo row + an unconditional
  cross-token bump kills a slow-in-flight-fetch race): HR shows ONLY the living star (a point-mass
  CO gets NO luminosity point — `hr.setBinaryTrack(states, null, {s1:"star"})`), `star.js`
  `CO_MARKER_FRAG`/`coMarker` draws a schematic 3D glyph beside it (BH = a persistent dark disc +
  ring, deliberately NOT the SN "winks out"; NS = a hot point), `roche.js drawLiveCo` draws the
  same point-mass marker (never a Teff disc) with the lobe as the accretion target, and the
  η·Ṁ·c² accretion cue is surfaced in the age-slider caption **relative to the star's own L**
  (~2.5× during RLOF1). The one backend touch: `co_binary_track_payload` folds in per-step Roche
  geometry by reusing `binary.track_roche_geometry` via a `SimpleNamespace` adapter (star→donor,
  CO→accretor, q=m_co/m_star). An advisor-flagged false-data leak fixed: the readout/scale/MK-class
  single-star consumers froze on the unrelated stripped snapshot → CSS-hidden in `.co-binary-view`.
  **Chunk 1c** (data + frontend + one backend correctness fix, mirrors HMS-HMS 4c/4d, **no
  runtime-logic change for the axis** — `co_binary_track` was already snap-always over the whole
  grid): extracted + baked the 7 non-solar buckets → the **full 8-bucket [Fe/H] axis** (−4.0…+0.30,
  coextensive with the HMS-HMS axis); a `#co-binary-feh` picker (populated from the real
  `available_feh`) + a "Custom system…" picker revealing three **log** sliders — the CO custom axis
  is **(M_star, M_co, P), NOT (M1, q, P)** (a CO's mass is a physical value ~1.2–307 M☉, not a
  ratio). **The full-grid pytest caught a real artifact:** the accretion-cue Eddington bound was
  SOLAR-ONLY characterized (2–3.5×); the metal-poor grids reach **505,221× Eddington** on a few rows
  — ALL on POSYDON `unstable_MT` (CE/merger) tracks (the served caption would've shown ~10^13× the
  star's own L, newly reachable via the picker/sliders). Gated the η·Ṁ·c² cue OFF `unstable_MT` (the
  `active` mask now needs `not is_unstable_mt`) → bounded **≤3.46× Eddington grid-wide**, the stable
  X-ray-binary payoff preserved. **Chunk-1c advisor follow-up (backend-only, +2 tests):** the
  accretion cue was ALSO leaking on **WD-companion** tracks — the frontend caption paints
  `accretion_lum_lsun` unconditionally when non-null, and 94 WD tracks surfaced a cue up to ~55,000 L☉
  computed with `ACCRETION_EFFICIENCY=0.1` (a NS/BH deep-potential-well η, ~2–3 dex too deep for a WD's
  shallow well → ~100–1000× too bright; the WD channel is a documented placeholder anyway, frozen
  1.0 M☉). Gated the cue OFF WD too (`active` now also needs `not is_wd`), so the cue is only ever
  painted in the NS/BH-stable regime it's physically valid in. The advisor's other flag — the grid-wide
  bound test RECOMPUTED over raw columns rather than reading the served cue (so test-gate and
  production-gate could diverge) — is closed by a new `test_served_accretion_cue_is_bounded_and_only_in_regime`
  that asserts the bound on `co_binary_track`'s OWN served `accretion_lum_lsun`, plus a WD-None served
  regression. **CO-HeMS / CO-HeMS_RLO Chunk 2a BUILT 2026-07-08 (backend-only, +38 tests):** the
  double-compact-object channel — the He-star twins of CO-HMS_RLO (schema recon confirmed a clean
  drop-in: `history2` absent, every column present, S1 a bare He star). `posydon_co.py` is
  **parameterized by a `kind` arg** (`VALID_KINDS = co-hms-rlo | co-hems | co-hems-rlo`, default
  behavior-compatible — additive `kind`/`dco` payload keys only) over per-kind baked dirs; `bake_posydon.py` gained `--grid-type co-hems`/`co-hems-rlo`
  (both through the existing `bake_co()` + a new per-track SN-model scalar block, `SN_MODEL_DEFAULT =
  S1_SN_MODEL_v2_01`). The novel payoff is `dco_classification` (a `DcoClassification` on
  `CoBinaryTrack`, **He kinds only**): POSYDON's own predicted S1 remnant + the known S2 → "BH + BH" /
  "NS + BH" / "NS + NS" merger progenitor, or honest "no DCO" (WD remnant / unresolved). Keys off
  remnant TYPE (handles low-Z PISN → None for free at 2c); prescription labeled BY INDEX; S2 DCO mass =
  final-row post-accretion. Optional SN-scalar load = **NO `BAKE_VERSION_CO` bump** (8 CO-HMS_RLO npzs
  not re-baked). **Eddington bound RE-DERIVED** (not assumed): 3.47× across both He solar grids
  (solar-scoped — re-derive at 2c, the metal-poor buckets carry the same `unstable_MT` artifact class).
  **CO-HeMS / CO-HeMS_RLO Chunk 2b BUILT 2026-07-09 (frontend render; frontend-only, NO backend
  change, 373 pytest unchanged, Playwright 1440+390 zero console errors):** the He-star channel's UI.
  Navigation settled to **advisor-endorsed Option A — a grid-`kind` `<select>` inside the EXISTING
  `.co-binary-view`** (not a parallel view), the axis orthogonal to `[Fe/H]`, mirroring the backend's
  parameterize-don't-fork: a `coKind` state var (default `co-hms-rlo`, byte-compatible) threaded into
  BOTH the track + meta fetch URLs as `&kind=`; the meta cache re-keyed on **`(kind, feh)`** (each kind
  is its own grid — the 4d stale-slider bug class). Three physical-label options; a kind change resets
  the custom triple to that kind's curated demo, re-fetches meta then track, and swaps the demo-button
  label + demo-row `?` tooltip. The curated demo triples are the **exact Chunk-2a-verified nodes**
  (`test_posydon_co_he.py`) — never guessed (a guess snaps to a WD/`unstable_MT` node → a dead demo).
  The **DCO-endpoint caption** (`#co-binary-dco-note`, He kinds only) prints the classifier's OWN served
  `data.dco.label` verbatim (+ a friendly prescription gloss). **He-surface comp** returns for He kinds
  (a `co-he-kind` body class set off the SERVED `data.kind`) driven per step by
  `comp.setStripped(s,{source:"posydon"})` — comp ALONE (spectrum/sed/structure stay hidden). **An
  advisor-caught false caption I'd hand-waved (the load-bearing fix):** the flagship CO-HeMS BH+BH demo
  scrubs He 99% → **Z≈72% C/O** (a WC/WO surface), where the reused `drawStripped`'s `heRich=Y>X` falsely
  read "helium-rich / the bared core is helium" — the SAME false-caption class the narration blocker
  killed. Fixed with a three-way `surfKind` (Z>Y → "carbon/oxygen-rich surface (Wolf–Rayet WC/WO)") AND a
  `source`-aware caption (the Götberg "one representative state" attribution is false on a time-varying
  POSYDON track); the single-star Götberg snapshot path is byte-unchanged.
  **CO-HeMS / CO-HeMS_RLO Chunk 2c BUILT 2026-07-09 (data + tests only — NO runtime-logic or frontend
  code change; 379 pytest [+6], Playwright 1440+390 zero console errors — PHASE 1 COMPLETE):** the full
  8-bucket [Fe/H] axis (−4.0…+0.30103, coextensive with CO-HMS_RLO) for BOTH He grids. Mirrors Chunk 1c/4d:
  `co_binary_track`/`_meta` were already snap-always over the whole per-kind grid and the `#co-binary-feh`
  picker already reads the real `available_feh` (meta cache keyed on `(kind, feh)`), so the He kinds picked
  up all 8 buckets with ZERO code edit (Playwright-verified: both He pickers list 8, a bucket switch
  re-fetches meta+track, the DCO caption re-computes). Extracted + baked the 7 non-solar buckets per He grid
  (one tar scan extracting both `*/CO-HeMS/*.h5` + `*/CO-HeMS_RLO/*.h5`, delete-after-bake; npzs gitignored).
  **The mandatory Eddington re-derivation across all 8 He buckets** (ungated, float64-cast, full grid — the
  exact step that caught the 505,221× `unstable_MT` artifact in CO-HMS_RLO Chunk 1c): the cue holds at
  **≤3.65× the CO's own Eddington** (co-hems-rlo at the metal-poor floor feh=−4.0; co-hems uniform 3.47×),
  and the **key finding is that the He grids are genuinely CLEANER than CO-HMS_RLO** — ZERO ungated rows >5×
  anywhere (no `unstable_MT`/WD artifact), so the re-derivation confirms "no artifact" rather than assuming
  it. Tests: +6 gated on `requires_posydon_co_he_multifeh` (×2 He kinds) — `available_feh` reflects the real
  baked set; the axis-is-real regression via the EVOLVED-track fingerprint (POSYDON reuses the SAME initial
  (M_star, M_co, P) grid per Z, so the signal is the evolved track not a distinct node — co-hems final
  He-star mass falls monotonically 16.46→8.42 M☉ across the axis from Z-dependent winds); DCO honest
  degradation over a whole metal-poor grid. The existing Eddington test auto-covers all 8 (loops
  `_available_grids(kind)`), its docstring updated to the re-derived number. The recurring wrong-bucket-test
  hazard ([[star-sim-hosted-data-assets]]) was checked and doesn't bite — every He test iterates the grids +
  fetches with `grid.feh`. **Phase 1 (the CE/compact-object tail) is now COMPLETE; next = Phase 2
  (initial-He / Y axis).** [[star-sim-co-hms-rlo]].
- **PATH (b) CHUNK 4d BUILT (frontend-only, NO backend change, Playwright-verified 1440+390 zero
  console errors):** the [Fe/H] metallicity-bucket picker — the frontend catch-up once
  [[star-sim-hosted-data-assets]] finished baking+hosting the FULL 8-bucket POSYDON axis
  ([Fe/H] ≈ −4.0…+0.30); `/binary_track`/`/binary_track_meta` already took a `feh` param
  (`binary_track_meta`'s `available_feh` field was already served) but `main.js` had it
  hardcoded to `feh=0` in both fetch call sites. A `<select id="binary-feh">` in
  `binary-demo-row`, populated from the real `available_feh` list (never hardcoded), applies
  to WHICHEVER system is showing — curated demo or "Custom orbit" — unlike M1/q/P which only
  ever drive "custom" (mirrors the MIST mass/[Fe/H] split: orthogonal axes). Deliberately kept
  visible during an active co-evolving movie (`.binary-feh-label` excluded from the
  `body.binary-view .binary-demo-btn` hide rule) so a user can compare metallicities without
  leaving it. A new `customFeh` state var + `refetchBinaryTrack` (renamed/generalized from
  `refetchBinaryCustom` — resolves (m1,q,p) for ANY active `binaryDemoKey`, not just
  "custom") + a `binary-feh-note` (always-visible snap-honesty line, the M1/q/P
  `binary-custom-note`'s counterpart but NOT hidden inside the custom-only controls). Switching
  buckets re-fetches `binary_track_meta` first (clamping customM1/Q/P + repositioning the
  custom sliders to the new bucket's bounds — each POSYDON metallicity is its OWN grid, so
  bounds differ) before re-fetching the track, avoiding a stale slider-vs-fetched mismatch.
  **Verified through the real app (Playwright):** the select lists all 8 real buckets; entering
  the Case-B demo at solar then switching to [Fe/H]=−1.0 re-fetches both routes and the note
  updates; on "Custom orbit" with M1 dragged to 280 (snaps to the grid ceiling 286 M☉,
  "stripped + companion" at solar) switching to the most metal-poor bucket ([Fe/H]=−4.0) at the
  SAME (M1,q,P) genuinely changes the outcome to "stable mass transfer" — real physics, not a
  cosmetic label swap. Zero console errors at 1440/390 px. Plan
  `docs/plans/entwined-consort-inspiral.md`; memory `star-sim-binary-stripped.md`.
- **PATH (b) CHUNK 4c BUILT (frontend-only, NO backend change, 310 pytest unchanged, Playwright
  1440+390 zero errors):** free M1/q/P sliders — `/binary_track` was already fully general
  (snap-always over the WHOLE POSYDON grid, §6); Chunk 4b's three curated demos were a UI
  de-risking choice, not a backend limit, so this needed no `posydon.py`/`api.py` touch. A
  fourth **"Custom orbit…"** demo button reveals three sliders (M1, q, P) driving the exact
  same `enterBinaryView` fetch path. Log-scale 0..1 position sliders for M1/P (measured span
  via `/binary_track_meta`: 3.92–286.4 M☉ ≈1.9 dex, 0.1–5179.5 d ≈4.7 dex — the ⁵⁶Ni-slider
  idiom), a direct linear binding for q (0.05–0.99, <1 dex). A note line always states the
  TRUE snapped node + outcome + any `*_snapped_far` flags, never the raw dragged numbers.
  **One real bug the first Playwright pass caught:** the sliders panel was revealed before
  the initial `/binary_track` fetch resolved, so a drag during that window landed while
  `binaryView` was still `false` and got silently dropped by `refetchBinaryCustom`'s own
  guard; fixed by moving the reveal to after `binaryView = true` (the same point the demo/
  Back buttons already gate their own interactivity on). Verified via a poll-based
  Playwright script: entering shows the Case-B default, dragging P to the log floor re-snaps
  to the real merger node, dragging M1 to the ceiling re-snaps far off-grid with an honest
  note, the scrubber/Back/re-entry all work. **Path (b) is now built end-to-end (Chunks
  1–4c, +4d above for the metallicity axis)** — what remains is the explicitly unscoped tail:
  richer CE/compact-object outcomes, a population overlay (BPASS). Plan
  `docs/plans/entwined-consort-inspiral.md`; memory `star-sim-binary-stripped.md`.
- **PATH (b) CHUNKS 4a & 4b BUILT — the two-star TIME render is live (310 pytest [+4]):**
  the on-ramp to a real binary grid — POSYDON HMS-HMS, the first TIME-SERIES, TWO-BODY
  sibling. **Chunk 4a** (backend, solar-first): the user landed all 8 metallicity tarballs
  (~84 GB, `data/Posydon/`); only solar is extracted + baked so far. Recon correction: the
  raw grid HDF5 is already per-run (`grid/run<i>/{binary_history,history1,history2}`), not
  POSYDON's packed `PSyGrid` — so `scripts/bake_posydon.py` reads it directly with plain
  h5py (host-side, filters `not_converged`/misaligned runs, verifies the
  run↔`initial_values` index identity, decimates >300-row tracks) into a flat CSR `.npz`
  (33,121 tracks/1.48M rows/142 MB); the runtime `star_sim/posydon.py` sibling is
  h5py/POSYDON-free, snaps (M1,q,P,[Fe/H]) in normalized log-M1/log-P/linear-q space to the
  nearest track (never interpolates, §6). **Gate 0 CLOSED** through the real runtime (demo
  system M1=8.83/q=0.6/P=3.73 d): the mass ordering crosses live (donor 8.83→1.07 M☉,
  companion 5.30→5.94 M☉), the period widens 3.73→6.94 d, `mt_state` fires a real
  detached→RLOF1→detached sequence. Two honest gaps vs the original plan guess: no
  eccentricity column (HMS-HMS circularizes; `ecc` is a labeled 0.0) and C/N/O-only
  composition (not MIST's 16-metal breakdown). `/binary_track` + `/binary_track_meta`
  bypass `PROVIDER`, snap-always. **Chunk 4b** (frontend, a deeper reveal INSIDE
  stripped-mode — mode stays `"stripped"` throughout, the WD-thermal-pulse sub-view
  pattern): three curated demo systems (same donor M1=8.83/q=0.6, only P differs — merger /
  the Gate-0 stripped+companion / detached), a "Co-evolve the system" button row that
  fetches `/binary_track` once and repurposes the age slider as a free index-linear
  system-time scrubber (mass/[Fe/H] disabled meanwhile — POSYDON's grid is independent of
  the MIST axes). `hr.js` gained a genuinely new drawing mode (`setBinaryTrack`/
  `updateBinaryIndex` — BOTH stars' full tracks, Teff-colored, independent past/future
  splits, markers fixed-labeled "donor"/"companion" by IDENTITY so the reversal is the
  crossing, never a relabel). The Roche panel (Chunk 3) goes LIVE (`roche.js drawLive`,
  the untouched static `drawPanel` stays for the snapshot): a **backend addition** was
  needed here — `binary.py`'s Roche engine was factored into a pure
  `_roche_geometry_from_params(q, m1, m2, a, n_samples)` + a new `track_roche_geometry`
  that `posydon.py` imports (sibling-calls-sibling, mirroring `structure.py` →
  `lane_emden.solve_lane_emden`; no `BAKE_VERSION` bump, computed at request time) at a
  decimated 40-sample resolution (~2ms/step vs the CSV path's 160-sample ~14ms, keeping a
  271-step track fetch under ~1s). Two real upgrades over the static snapshot: both stars
  get a REAL Teff/R every step (drawn as real discs always), and whichever star `mt_state`
  flags as overflowing gets its lobe filled + the stream (measured/labeled: the real
  photospheric radius does NOT itself cross the lobe outline during RLOF — a local L1
  excess, not whole-photosphere inflation). 3D is free (`star.update(s1,{companion:s2})`,
  the exact Chunk-2 call, now driven every scrub frame). Playwright-verified 1440+390,
  zero console errors, the Case-B markers visibly cross and the Roche lobes visibly
  reshape/fill through a real detached→RLOF1→detached sequence. **Chunk 4c (free q/P
  sliders) is now built too — see the bullet above.** Plan
  `docs/plans/entwined-consort-inspiral.md`.
- **PATH (b) CHUNK 3 BUILT (backend + frontend, 287 pytest [+8], Playwright 1440+390 zero errors):**
  "the mass-transfer geometry / Roche lobes" — a genuinely new TWO-STAR render: the orbital-plane
  figure-of-eight at the moment of Case-B RLOF (the causal story behind the stripped star). Advisor-settled
  Option B (the RLOF *moment*, a 2D plane view, separation from a new `P_init` CSV column via Kepler; NOT
  3D Roche surfaces). Honest geometry (lobe shape from q=0.8 alone; L1/L2/L3 by bisecting dΦ/dx; lobe
  outlines by radial march to the critical Kopal equipotential — the **L1-tangent bug** fixed by stopping
  at the first crit-crossing OR Φ-turnover so the lobes kiss). The RLOF donor is a bloated cool giant of
  un-modelled Teff → **schematic warm tint, never the stripped Teff**; the companion is drawn at its real
  modelled radius, compact inside its lobe. **The blocker (advisor): the cross-panel mass-ordering
  REVERSAL** (donor is the HEAVIER M1 here vs the LIGHTER post-strip object everywhere else — same class as
  the Chunk-1 q-bug) is owned by the panel intro + caption. Pure `roche_geometry()` (no PROVIDER) folded
  into `binary_pair_payload`; new `roche.js` panel CSS-gated to `body.stripped-mode.companion-on`.
  **Next (b) Chunk 4: the on-ramp to a real binary grid (POSYDON/BPASS) — a separate recon+handoff.**
- **PATH (b) CHUNK 2 BUILT (frontend-only, 279 pytest UNCHANGED, Playwright 1440+390 zero errors):**
  "the companion drawn in 3D" — the accretor as a REAL second sphere beside the stripped donor. **No
  backend touch** (the companion state is already served by `/binary_pair`). **Honesty split (advisor):**
  the *sphere* is Tier 1/2 honest (a real modeled single-star state → the full surface shader: Teff
  color, relative size, granulation, limb darkening), unlike the evocative corona/wind/fireball; what's
  NOT modeled is the geometry BETWEEN the stars (no separation/orbit) → the side-by-side placement is
  SCHEMATIC, caption-owned (un-drawn-orbit precedent). `star.js` = a 2nd `companion` sphere (own
  `ShaderMaterial`, per-star uniforms differ) + a `companionGlare` (7–27 kK would blaze), no 2nd corona;
  `update(state,{companion})` lays donor LEFT / companion RIGHT via direct `mesh.position.x`
  (camera-facing quads stay parallel under x-shift — no billboard math), relative log-size preserved
  (companion bigger than the compact donor IS the reversal in 3D), a shared `applyCompanionScale`
  fit-to-frame factor (`FRAME_HALF_H` precedent, re-run each frame → live-resize refit), both glares
  TEMPERED ×0.6 (glare-merge trap), `companionMat.uTime` in `animate()` (else boil freezes); all
  offsets+`.visible` UNCONDITIONAL → toggle-off byte-identical. `main.js` threads the companion state +
  the schematic caption sentence. Measured: donor stays compact (R 0.16→0.88 R☉) vs the MS companion
  (1.83→7.76 R☉) at every node → "companion bigger" reads everywhere. NO 3D text labels (scope; left=donor
  matches the HR blue-left). Next (b) Chunk 3: Roche-lobe geometry, then a real binary grid. [[star-sim-binary-stripped]].
- **Chunks 1 (backend) & 2 (frontend what-if mode) & 3 (stripped-star spectra) BUILT — path (a) COMPLETE.**
  **Chunk 3** (backend + frontend, 273 pytest, Playwright 1440+390 zero console errors): a FOURTH
  spectrum sibling **`/stripped_spectrum`** over the Götberg CMFGEN cube — `scripts/bake_stripped_spectra.py`
  bakes a **flat-node** host-baked cube (like WR, not rectangular Teff×logg) keyed on the SAME `(Z, M_init)`
  node `/binary` snaps (state↔spectrum consistency), **solar-only**, from `normalised_spectrum.txt`
  (CMFGEN **continuum-normalized** Fnorm → no continuum estimation), **vac→air** + **sort-by-λ** (measured
  gotchas). `spectra.py stripped_spectrum_data` + `spectrum.js updateStripped` = a **bidirectional** draw
  (absorption dips at the subdwarf end, emission peaks at the He-star end; `display_max` cap, continuum line
  at 1.0, regime-branched caption). Reads the resolved node off `state.mass_init_msun`/`feh_init` (no drift).
  **Measure-first gate CLOSED through the runtime:** the absorption→emission sequence is real & monotone
  (2 M☉ pure absorption Hα 0.50 → 18 M☉ He II 4686 **7.2×** emission), distinct from the false O-star Balmer
  spectrum the Chunk-2 placeholder protected against. Bonus: fixed a pre-existing `.spectrum-zoom[hidden]`
  CSS leak (zoom presets leaked into every endgame + stripped mode — dead in WR/SN/stripped, working-but-
  meant-hidden in WD). Recipe §10. Path (b) (two-star co-evolution) stays deferred.
  **Chunk 2** (frontend-only, 266 pytest
  UNCHANGED, Playwright 1440+390 zero console errors): the reversible `mode="stripped"`. Entry-point
  (i) settled — a **mass-gated TOGGLE** (`#stripped-toggle`, mirrors the Ap/Bp control) for eligible
  progenitors (2–18.2 M☉), a MID-LIFE FORK (not an end-of-life gateway) that still snaps the whole
  display, fetched from `/binary`. **One exit** — the shared endgame-bar "Back" (`exitEndgame`, which
  captures `prevMode` to return the fork to the age it forked FROM, not the track end); unchecking
  calls the same. **The three false-data leaks blocked (advisor):** HR keeps the progenitor's living
  track faint + drops the marker **blue-left** (reuses `hr.setEndgame([s],"stripped")` auto-fit, no
  hr.js change); **comp = a NEW single-state SURFACE view** (`comp.setStripped`/`drawStripped` — the
  measured He-rich H/He/Z bar; the core is by-construction so NOT drawn); **spectrum → placeholder**
  (the main cube is H-atmosphere → a He-star would paint a FALSE O-star Balmer spectrum); **structure
  → not called** (keeps its last profile). `classify.strippedLabel` (sdO/B < 1.5 M☉ → He-star above,
  via `opts.mStrip`); age slider DISABLED (one representative state). SED wind tail off + honest for
  free (`mdot=None` → `computeWindTail` null). Re-snap (`tryStrippedResnap`): snap-always, no revert —
  a drag past the grid edges shows an in-band snapped-far caption note. [[star-sim-binary-stripped]];
  plan `docs/plans/stripped-consort-unveiling.md`. **Next = Chunk 3** (stripped-star spectra, deferred).
- **Chunk 1 BUILT (backend vertical, solar-first).** The hot He-rich core a close companion
  exposes by Case-B Roche-lobe overflow (Götberg+2018) — the dominant observed stripped/WR
  channel, retiring the single-star-WR "minority channel" caveat. It's the first build from
  the atlas Tier-D **binarity** item, **path (a)** (the stripped endpoint; path (b) two-star
  co-evolution deferred). A **sibling** (a binary product can't pass the single-star §3
  interface): `binary.py` imports only `state.StellarState`, `/binary` bypasses `PROVIDER`,
  exactly like `supernova.py`/`structure.py`. `backend/star_sim/data/gotberg_z014.csv` is the
  **committed** Z=0.014 table (23 rows, SED-verified ≤0.07 dex; only the spectra stay
  gitignored under `data/gotberg_stripped/`). `stripped_star(mass, feh)` **snaps** (Z, Minit)
  → nearest node (never interpolates, §6) → a `StrippedStar` = the §3-clean `StellarState` +
  routing scalars (`m_strip_msun` [CURRENT mass — no home on the state], snapped m_init/Z,
  `*_snapped_far` flags, `mass_grid_min/max`). Route is **snap-always** (out-of-grid flagged
  in-band, 422 only for mass≤0). **Gotchas baked in:** Teff/Reff not T★; `Z_surf`=grid Z with
  (X_H,X_He) renormalized to 1−Z; `mdot=None` + no lifetime (not in the 8-col table). The
  **visibility gate keys Teff+Y_surf only, NEVER L** (advisor catch: L flips sign across the
  grid — M_strip≪M_init). 266 pytest (12 new in `test_binary.py`; `requires_gotberg_data`
  guards the SED regression). Adding the 3 non-solar Z tables = drop a CSV + one `_GRID_TABLES`
  tuple. **Next = Chunk 2** (frontend what-if `stripped-mode`). [[star-sim-binary-stripped]];
  plan `docs/plans/stripped-consort-unveiling.md`.

### Initial-helium (Y) overlay (`helium.py` — a **sibling**; `/helium` bypasses PROVIDER)
- **PHASE 2 of `docs/plans/tempered-lineage-inspiral.md` — BUILT end-to-end 2026-07-09 (Chunks
  2a/2b/2c, 387 pytest, Playwright-verified 1440+390).** The globular-cluster **second-generation**
  what-if: at fixed mass/[Fe/H] a He-enhanced star (Y≈0.40, ω Cen / NGC 2808) is **hotter, brighter,
  shorter-lived** than a primordial-Y one (Y≈0.27) — μ↑→L↑→τ_MS=M/L↓, the HB "second-parameter"
  effect. A **what-if overlay sibling** like Ap/Bp; the load-bearing honesty rule is it is **NEVER
  compared against the live MIST spine** — a He-enhanced MESA track is only shown against a MESA
  **baseline** (identical inlist, Y the sole difference), because MESA-vs-MIST would conflate the He
  effect with the documented MESA-vs-MIST systematic. **Chunk 2a (data):** Claude ran the 6-run
  batch in Docker MESA himself (the user said "docker is on, bake it yourself") — inlists differ ONLY
  in `initial_mass` (1/2/6) and `initial_y` (baseline 0.2704 / enhanced 0.40); **`Zbase=initial_z=
  0.0152` in BOTH** (the Y axis leaves Z fixed — the metallicity "change Zbase too" gotcha does NOT
  apply). Output `data/mesa_helium/{baseline,enhanced}/<M>Msun/history.data` (gitignored under `/data/*`;
  tests skip via `requires_helium_data`) — but **now hosted** on the `mesa-helium-baked-v1` Release
  (`python -m star_sim.fetch_helium_baked`, alongside `fetch_alpha_baked`): the hosted-data-assets
  "excludes MESA" rule is specifically the **third-party bearums** validation tracks (all-rights-
  reserved); **self-run** helium/alpha output is this project's OWN computed tracks — the same class as
  MIST (itself published MESA output) — so it IS hosted (advisor-endorsed carve-out). **No npz bake**
  (advisor): 4 MB read directly by the reused parser. **Gate 2 PASSED at every mass** (matched-phase):
  τ_MS 2.7×/2.1×/1.9× shorter, ZAMS bluer+brighter. **Chunk 2b (backend):** `helium.py` imports only
  `state.StellarState` + the MESA parser's **free** helpers `_build_track`/`_state_from_track` (never
  PROVIDER), keys pairs by **ZAMS surface He** `Ys[0]` (not dir name), asserts exactly two per mass;
  `/helium?mass=` snap-always (1/2/6, solar Z), 422 on mass≤0; lifted `_state_from_track` to module
  level for reuse (method delegates, MESA tests unchanged). **Chunk 2c (frontend):** a **light HR
  overlay, not a mode-swap** — `#helium-toggle` (mass 0.7–7, |[Fe/H]|≤0.25) → new minimal
  `hr.setHeliumOverlay` draws two Teff-coloured MESA trails, each ZAMS-labeled, **MIST track hidden**;
  static (no marker); 3D/spectrum/comp stay on the current star. **τ_MS (invisible on an HR diagram —
  advisor catch) surfaced in the `#helium-note` caption** with both lifetimes + ratio. Tears down on
  band-exit or any endgame/stripped entry. **Data-availability honesty gate** (advisor-caught freeze
  on the data-absent fresh-clone path): `/helium_status`→`has_grid` (the `/rotation_status` pattern)
  hides the toggle without local MESA runs, + a fetch-failure `heliumOff()` teardown.
  [[star-sim-helium-overlay]]; recipe `backend/docs/mesa_helium_recipe.md`.

### α-enhanced (equivalent-Z) overlay (`alpha.py` — a **sibling**; `/alpha` bypasses PROVIDER)
- **PHASE 3 of `docs/plans/tempered-lineage-inspiral.md` — BUILT end-to-end 2026-07-09 (Chunks
  3a/3b/3c, 397 pytest, Playwright-verified 1440+390). This COMPLETES the whole tempered-lineage
  plan (Phases 1–3).** The old-population what-if: at fixed [Fe/H], boosting [α/Fe] raises the
  true total metallicity Z (α-elements dominate the metal mass), so at fixed mass the track is
  **cooler, fainter, longer-lived** — the **opposite sign** from the He effect. A what-if overlay
  sibling like `helium.py`; NEVER compared vs. the MIST spine (MESA-vs-MESA only). **The
  "heaviest phase" collapsed to Phase-2 difficulty (advisor-endorsed):** MESA ships only
  solar-scaled opacity tables (Type-1 on the MS; Type-2 only blends in H-poor → no α on the MS),
  and **Salaris, Chieffi & Straniero (1993)** show an α-enhanced track ≈ a scaled-solar track at
  the **equivalent total Z** to a few percent (below what this sim resolves) — so it's a **Z-only
  change** (`[M/H]=[Fe/H]+log10(0.638·10^[α/Fe]+0.362)`; [α/Fe]=+0.4 → Z_equiv=0.0152·1.9646=
  **0.029862**, Y held at 0.2704 — the "change Zbase too" gotcha **applies here**, unlike the Y
  axis). **Chunk 3a:** Claude ran the 6-run MESA batch in Docker himself (user turned Docker on,
  "you bake"); Gate 3 measured **via the parser that skips pre-MS** (raw row 0 is the cool Hayashi
  pre-MS model — a gotcha): cooler/fainter/longer at every mass (1 M☉ ΔTeff −488 K/τ_MS 1.49×; 6
  M☉ −1606 K/1.12×). **Chunk 3b:** `alpha.py` keys the pair by **ZAMS surface Z** (not Y); `alpha_fe`
  is **DERIVED** from the measured baseline/enhanced Z ratio via inverted Salaris (recovers +0.40,
  not hardcoded); `/alpha` + `/alpha_status`; +9 tests (`test_alpha.py`). **Chunk 3c:** a LIGHT HR
  overlay **sharing the He overlay slot**, mutually exclusive with it (each toggle unchecks the
  other); `hr.setHeliumOverlay` generalized to custom **[M/H]** ZAMS labels; the Coelho-paired
  caption owns the lesson ("the track sees only total Z — α's signature is spectroscopic, see the
  spectrum α-toggle"). **Playwright caught a duplicate-ID collision** — `#alpha-toggle` was already
  the Coelho spectrum α-toggle; renamed mine to `#alpha-track-toggle`. Gate-3 part-2 (distinctiveness)
  IS the lesson, not a defect. [[star-sim-alpha-overlay]]; recipe `backend/docs/mesa_alpha_recipe.md`.

### SED (broadband panel — **sibling**, Teff-driven; mostly frontend, one tiny spine touch)
- `sed.js` plots the Planck blackbody γ→radio (~14 decades), Wien peak, optical
  bracket. Non-thermal overlay: a cool-star coronal X-ray band + Güdel–Benz radio
  (Chunk 1) that **collapses to a rotation→X-ray line** when rotation is supplied
  (age-gyrochronology or a user slider; Chunk 3). **Chunks 1, 2 & 3 ALL BUILT** — the
  SED non-thermal arc is complete. **Chunk 2 = the hot-star wind thermal free–free
  excess** (the one data-grounded tier): a solid teal-green λ⁻²·⁶ line from the real
  mass-loss rate, drawn where it crests the photospheric floor (Wright–Barlow). It is
  the SED's only **spine touch** — `mdot_msun_yr: float | None` is now on `StellarState`
  (the `Mdot` `_Track` column blended LINEARLY like `Vrot`, **no `CACHE_VERSION` bump**;
  Stub/MESA emit `None`). **Measure-first correction (advisor-led):** the feature is a
  mid/far-IR → sub-mm excess for **EVOLVED hot supergiants** (peaks ~35–260 µm, dec
  −8…−12), **NOT** the ZAMS-O "mm/radio" the plan's table claimed (that was ~4 dex too
  bright + circular — fixed by anchoring the coefficient on ζ Pup + a proven BB norm,
  not on the in-house number). Slope robust; level ±dex (v∞ bistability + clumping).
  [[star-sim-nonthermal-sed-plan]]; plan `docs/plans/magnetic-ember-broadcast.md`.

### Interior structure (real MESA radial profiles — a **sibling**; the honest Lane–Emden successor)
- **BUILT — the three interior regimes: 0.25 M☉ fully-convective M dwarf + 1 M☉ solar radiative-core↔
  convective-envelope + the 2/6/15/25 M☉ convective-core↔radiative-envelope FLIP; PLUS the metallicity
  axis (1 M☉ at [Fe/H]=−1/+0.5, the convective envelope shallows as Z drops).** `/structure` bypasses
  `PROVIDER` (like `/polytrope`, `/spectrum`): interior structure is a sibling, not a
  `StellarState`. `structure.py` reads offline MESA `profile.data` snapshots under
  `data/mesa_profiles/` (gitignored) with its **own** MESA-profile parser (never imports
  a provider — a §3 boundary rule) and snaps a request to the nearest saved snapshot in
  **(mass, [Fe/H], age)**, reporting the *true* snapped values (no interpolation across
  snapshots — the panel **jumps**, honestly labeled "nearest saved snapshot"). Returns
  center-normalized ρ(r)/T(r)/P(r) + X/Y/Z vs r/R, the **real convective/radiative split**
  (MESA `mixing_type==1` ∪ Schwarzschild `gradr>grada`), central scalars (ρ_c/T_c/P_c/R/M),
  and the **two canonical polytrope overlays (n=1.5, n=3)** — NOT a best fit; the canonical
  curves bracket the real ρ and the departure IS the lesson (advisor-settled: a fitted n
  would hide the very mismatch the panel exists to show). `expected_n` is a labeled hint
  from the *core* type (radiative→3 / convective→3/2), not a fit. Frontend `structure.js`
  is a **live consumer** wired into `paintState` (own debounced latest-wins fetch); draws
  ρ bold + T/X thinner + dashed polytrope references + shaded convective bands, a snapshot
  caption, a scalar readout, and a **snapped-far note** when the star is off-grid (snaps to
  the nearest of the 0.25/1/2/6/15/25 M☉ slices — honestly stated). **Why MESA-only/offline:** MIST ships
  no radial profiles and a live solve is out of scope (§2/§9), so profiles are self-run once
  (Docker MESA, the solar recipe + profile snapshots — `backend/docs/mesa_structure_recipe.md`).
  **Measured (mid-MS, ≈ solar age):** ρ_c≈190 g/cm³, T_c≈1.66×10⁷ K, R≈1.06 R☉, radiative
  core (n=3) + convective envelope base at r/R≈0.75 (SSM ≈0.71; the run is NOT solar-
  calibrated, hence loose test tolerances). Near-ZAMS shows a **real transient convective
  core** (MESA `mixing_type==1`, the early-MS ¹²C→¹⁴N-burning core before CN equilibrium) →
  an honest `expected_n=3/2` label flip, verified against the raw column, not an OR-clause
  artifact. The **2 & 6 M☉ slice** is the mirror — a **convective core** (CNO, centrally
  peaked) under a **radiative envelope**, so `expected_n` flips to **3/2** and the envelope is
  radiative at r/R≈0.9 (measured 6 M☉ mid-MS ρ_c≈16, T_c≈2.95×10⁷ K, R≈3.89 R☉, core r/R 0→0.131;
  2 M☉ core 0→0.088). **NO runtime code change** (the index globs the tree, snaps on the header
  mass/Z/age — "drops in as a bucket"); the accompanying change is data + tests: a new
  `requires_structure_massive` marker (gated on a ≥4 M☉ slice so the flip test *skips* not fails
  on a 1 M☉-only checkout), 3 flip tests, and one stale off-grid-snap test fixed (7.3 M☉ now snaps
  to 6.0). The advisor semiconvection-OR caveat was re-checked at this slice → it doesn't bite (the
  `mixing_type∪Schwarzschild` OR adds nothing beyond `mixing_type==1` here). Snapshot-selection is
  the real risk (a massive convective core *shrinks toward TAMS* → deliberately kept a healthy
  mid-MS Xc≈0.4 anchor). The **15 M☉ slice** (the SN arc's canonical progenitor — honest structure
  where the SN feature lives, was snapping to 6 M☉) is the **deepest** convective core of the set
  (ρ_c≈5.9, T_c≈3.5×10⁷ K, R≈6.67 R☉, core r/R 0→0.178; mid-MS anchor profile11, Xc 0.41) — **NO
  runtime change** again (drops in as a bucket), +1 gated test (`requires_structure_massive` already
  covers it, no conftest change), advisor OR-clause re-checked at 15 M☉ (every OR-added cell r/R≥0.97
  → no mid-radius over-shading). The **25 M☉ slice** brackets the upper SN-progenitor range — the
  **deepest** convective core of the ladder (ρ_c≈3.79, T_c≈3.78×10⁷ K, R≈8.47 R☉, core 0→0.228;
  0.131→0.178→0.228), same drop-in (no runtime change), +1 gated test, OR-clause re-checked (zero
  mid-radius over-shade). The **0.25 M☉ slice** is the **third regime — a fully-convective M dwarf**
  (advisor chose it over the literal "Next: other-Z": a new *regime* is visible-by-construction so
  the honesty gate is met automatically): a single convective zone spanning **0→1** (the whole star),
  `expected_n`→3/2, ρ_c≈135–138, T_c≈7.4×10⁶ K (below the Sun's — weak pp), R≈0.247 R☉. Two
  advisor-flagged **run** changes (unlike the pure drop-ins): **`max_age=2d9` replaces the TAMS stop**
  (a 0.25 M☉ MS lifetime is ~10¹²⁻¹³ yr — the central-H stop never fires, Xc barely moves) and **ship a
  settled-MS profile, not a pre-MS-contracting one** (profiles 20/21/22 of 22, L settled ~0.0105 L☉).
  **The polytrope-honesty INVERSION** (measured before writing it into the caption): a fully-convective
  star *is* the textbook n=3/2 polytrope, so the real ρ **hugs the n=1.5 overlay** (~1–5%) and sits far
  above n=3 — **the one bucket where the idealization works**, inverting the panel's usual "the departure
  is the lesson." NOT a pure drop-in: +`requires_structure_lowmass` marker (≤0.5 M☉ gate) + 2 tests +
  the off-grid snap probe re-pointed 0.3→0.15 (0.25 is now the grid floor) + a small `structure.js`
  caption refinement ("fully convective …the rare case the real profile follows it"; blank conv.base).
  **18 tests** (`test_structure.py`); 238 pytest total. Playwright-verified 1440 px (6/15 M☉ "convective
  core → canonical n = 3/2"; 0.25 M☉ "fully convective", ρ overlapping the n=1.5 dash, whole-panel
  convective shading; zero console errors). The **metallicity axis** added — the first non-mass slice
  (1 M☉ at [Fe/H]=−1.0 and +0.5): the solar-abundance-problem effect, lower Z → more transparent
  envelope → **shallower convective envelope** (base at higher r/R). **Gating measurement first, at
  matched Xc not age** (a metal-poor 1 M☉ is hotter/shorter-lived): mid-MS envelope base **0.70/0.75/
  0.95** at [Fe/H] **+0.5/0/−1** — visibly, monotonically distinct → clears the honesty gate. **NOT a
  core-type flip** (advisor-predicted): core stays radiative, `expected_n=3` at every Z; the whole
  payoff is the envelope-depth band. −2.0 run too but **not shipped** (base 0.99, fragments). **MESA
  gotcha: change `Zbase` too, not just `initial_z`** (round Z → clean [Fe/H] label auto). **Runtime NO
  code change** (the index already snapped mass→feh→age; frontend already passed the marker's [Fe/H]);
  data (`1Msun_fehm1p0`/`1Msun_fehp0p5`) + `requires_structure_multifeh` marker + 1 trend test + a
  **[Fe/H]-snapped-far note** (`structure.js`, the Z grid is 1 M☉-only) + the conv.base tooltip Z-link.
  Recipe §10. The **[Fe/H] axis now lives at a SECOND mass — the 0.8 M☉ K dwarf** (§11), so the
  interior grid is a genuine **partial 2D (mass × [Fe/H]) grid** for the first time. Same regime as
  the Sun (radiative core + conv. envelope) but a deeper envelope → the Z-shallowing is stronger AND
  **stays a single unfragmented zone at every Z** (base **0.66/0.69/0.81** at [Fe/H] +0.5/0/−1,
  matched-Xc-measured, monotone, core stays radiative n=3 — not a flip). **Chosen by measurement over
  two rejects:** 6 M☉ convective-*core* edge (the novel Z-on-a-core lesson) **failed the gate** (~0.02
  shift, non-monotonic below Xc 0.5 — massive stars respond to Z in R/Teff, not core fraction); 1.3 M☉
  envelope gave a clean 2-point but **fragments into ~0.99 slivers by [Fe/H]=−0.5** (real mixing_type,
  not OR-artifact — checked), so not shipped. **Runtime NO code change** again (mass→feh→age snap; a
  Z-less mass falls back to solar — both verified through the real `interior_structure()` path); +3
  data dirs (`solar_0p8Msun`/`0p8Msun_fehp0p5`/`0p8Msun_fehm1p0`) + 1 trend test (mass-parametrized
  `_midms_envelope_base`, existing `requires_structure_multifeh` marker) + a `structure.js` comment
  refresh (note reads the snapped result → correct as the axis grows). **238 pytest**, Playwright-
  verified 1440 (conv. band shallows 0.659→0.694→0.807 across +0.5→−1, zero console errors). **Next:**
  extend the [Fe/H] axis to more masses (clean on the lower MS, fails in the convective-core regime —
  verify visible first), or ship the 1.3 M☉ double-convective structure on its own merits.

### Frontend & UX
- Other panels/features: Lane–Emden interior (§8), true-size scale bar (with
  **swallowed-orbit rings** — an engulfed orbit fills with the star's tint), MK
  classification, instability-strip HR overlay, tooltip singleton, age-slider
  landmark ticks, responsive draggable dashboard, **first-load skeleton sheen**
  (`<body class="loading">`, removed on first paint/error; per-ID CSS selectors —
  the canvas `#id` background shorthand outranks a class rule), the **polish batch**
  (comp bulk-view boundary dots at the cursor + brighter phase labels; tick-label
  10.5px / SED band-name 11px legibility bumps; header tag → "ZAMS → remnant"
  — the stale "Phase 5 · spectra" retired). **No JS test harness → the
  Playwright screenshot pass IS the regression check** (use Playwright's bundled
  Chromium — `chrome --headless` hijacks the user's running Chrome).

### Coeval-ensemble overlay (BPASS — the **first ENSEMBLE sibling**; `/population` + `/population_hrd` bypass PROVIDER)
- **Chunk 2 BUILT 2026-07-10 — the HR-diagram NUMBER-DENSITY overlay (the HR-panel twin of Chunk 1's
  SED wedge; 405 pytest [+2], Playwright 1440+390 zero console errors).** At the marker's ([Fe/H], age)
  the coeval population's star count per (logTeff, logL) cell, single vs +binaries, drawn as a
  translucent cloud on the LIVE HR panel with the user's star as one point in it. **Data is a DIFFERENT
  release from Chunk 1's v2.3 spectra** (the v2.3 Zenodo record is spectra-ONLY) — the BPASS **v2.2.1**
  `hrs` files, **RANGE-extracted** from the 1.5 GB starter-kit Zenodo zip (10.5281/zenodo.7340797,
  pulling only the 26 `hrs-{sin,bin}.z*.dat` members via HTTP ranges + `zipfile`, never the whole zip;
  DataCentral 500'd on big files, Google-Drive is hard headless). Schema from `hoki.load._hrTL`: TL type,
  3 surface-H blocks (the low-H = stripped/He stars), z-code→[Fe/H]=log10(Z/0.020) in the FILENAME.
  `scripts/bake_bpass_hrd.py` → `data/bpass/bpass_hrd.npz` (~1.6 MB, sparse; crops the mostly-empty
  100×100 grid to logt(28)×logl(100)); `bpass.py population_hrd()`+`hrd_available()` over a 2nd cube
  (`BAKE_VERSION_HRD`); `/population_hrd` + `/population_status` `has_hrd`. Frontend **rides the EXISTING
  `#population-toggle`** (one concept, both panels): `refreshPopulation` fetches both routes in parallel
  (HRD degrades via `.catch(null)`) → `hr.setPopulationHRD` draws MAGENTA **strict binary-only** cells
  (single <0.1% of binary — the literal Gate-0 cells single evolution leaves empty: blue stragglers/
  stripped-He) + faint CYAN where singles genuinely share + a bottom-left legend, with an absolute
  **MIN_COUNT=0.01 stars cutoff** so ~1e-10-star cells don't paint a false flood. **Gate 0 (measured,
  solar 40 Myr): single hot-region (logTeff>4.4) count 0, binary ~283; ~33× more stripped stars.**
  **Build gotcha, TWO passes (Playwright + advisor, not the tests): (1) a too-narrow 4-decade alpha
  range hid the whole magenta payoff (sparse hot cells clamped to 0 alpha); (2) the over-correction
  (wide range + bare floor) painted ~1e-10-star cells as a magenta FLOOD whose "binary-only" label
  overstated the data — the false-caption class this project keeps catching; fixed with strict
  `s<1e-3·b` + the count cutoff so the picture IS the measured claim.** HRD hosting (the SED's
  Chunk-3 analogue) is a clean follow-up — the cube's host-baked/gitignored and `has_hrd` hides the cloud
  on a data-less clone. [[star-sim-coeval-ensemble-bpass.md]].
- **Chunk 1 BUILT 2026-07-10** (`docs/plans/coeval-ensemble-overlay.md`, 403 pytest, Playwright
  1440+390 zero console errors). Not a track / one state / one two-body system — a whole **coeval
  stellar population** (10⁶ M☉ born together at the marker's [Fe/H], seen at the marker's age) as an
  INTEGRATED spectrum, split **single-star vs. binary**, overlaid on the SED panel. Data = **BPASS
  v2.3** (population synthesis — NOT POSYDON tracks). `bpass.py` is a **pure numpy/stdlib sibling**
  (imports NOT even `StellarState`; AST-tested) over a host bake `scripts/bake_bpass_spectra.py` →
  `data/bpass/bpass_ssp.npz` (4.1 MB gitignored; λ log-rebin-AVERAGED 100000→1200). `population_sed`
  snaps ([Fe/H] linear, age **nearest-in-log10**), **converts f_ν→f_λ (×c/λ²)** (matches the panel's
  F_λ axis, preserves the sin/bin ratio); `/population` (snap-always, 503 unbaked) + `/population_status`
  (honesty gate). Frontend: `sed.js setPopulation`/`clearPopulation` (pushed-data consumer) draws BOTH
  curves **co-scaled to one shared reference** (the gap IS `log(F_bin/F_sin)`, NOT own-peak-each) +
  **fills the magenta WEDGE where bin>sin** — the payoff (binaries keep it UV/ionizing-bright:
  measured **~256× ionizing @40 Myr, ~26× FUV @1 Gyr**, optical unchanged); coronal/wind decluttered
  while on; population-aware caption. `#population-toggle` (opt-in, gated on the baked cube, **NOT
  mass-gated** — reads only feh+age), fetches on (feh,age)-node change, torn down on mode switch.
  **The build gotcha (Playwright caught it, not the tests):** a wrong dict-key (`lam_ang` vs served
  `wavelength`) drew NOTHING → looked like a fatal 14-decade-axis compression problem → a one-line
  fix; **verify the data reaches the canvas before blaming the representation.**
  **Chunk 3 BUILT 2026-07-10 (hosting):** `fetch_bpass_baked.py` + the `bpass-baked-v1` GitHub
  Release (the **9th** hosted tag) pull the 4.1 MB `bpass_ssp.npz` past the ~1 GB Zenodo pair +
  bake — mirrors `fetch_coelho_baked.py` (the single self-contained cube: a flat
  `{GRID_FILENAME: sha256}` over `_baked_release.fetch_one`, NOT the helium/alpha 2-tuple mapping).
  No loader/test change (the cube has no MIST-style raw-source fingerprint — pure `np.load` +
  `bake_version`); the only runtime touch is `bpass.py`'s `_MISSING_HINT` (now leads with the baked
  fast path). BPASS v2.3 is **CC-BY 4.0** (cleanest grant, like POSYDON). Verified end-to-end into
  a fresh `STAR_SIM_BPASS_DIR` (fresh subprocess → `"ok"` → `population_sed` serves the ionizing
  wedge from downloaded bytes). Next = Chunk 2 (HRD number-density, separate BPASS "numbers"
  release). [[star-sim-coeval-ensemble-bpass]], [[star-sim-hosted-data-assets]].

### Tests
- **405 pytest** (gated by data present via `conftest.py` markers; MIST tests skip
  if grids absent). The coeval-population overlay sibling (`test_bpass.py`) adds **8** (7 gated +
  1 UNGATED `/population_status`, which now also asserts `has_hrd`): **Chunk 1's** Gate-0 UV/ionizing
  bin>sin regression through the runtime (ionizing bin>3× sin @40 Myr, FUV bin>3× sin @1 Gyr, optical
  ~unchanged), snap honesty, age-log-snap, route shape+`population` selector+422, the AST
  sibling-imports-no-PROVIDER-**and-no-StellarState** check (a population is not a star); **plus
  Chunk 2's +2** (gated `requires_bpass_hrd_data`): the HRD Gate-0 hot-cell regression through the
  runtime (single hot-region count 0, binary populated, ≥10 binary-only cells, stripped_bin>5×
  stripped_sin) and the `/population_hrd` snap/route/selector/422 shape. The α-enhanced (equivalent-Z)
  overlay sibling (`test_alpha.py`) adds **9**
  (gated `requires_alpha_data`, mirroring helium; 1 UNGATED `/alpha_status` test): the per-mass
  Gate-3 asserts (enhanced ZAMS Teff/L **lower**, τ_MS **longer** — the opposite sign from He),
  the derived-[α/Fe]≈+0.4 check (recovered from the Z ratio via inverted Salaris, not hardcoded),
  §3-state validity, snap honesty, route/422, and the AST sibling-imports-no-PROVIDER check.
  The initial-helium (Y) overlay sibling (`test_helium.py`) adds **9**:
  **8** gated `requires_helium_data` (per-mass Gate-2 asserts — enhanced ZAMS Teff/L higher,
  τ_MS shorter; the observed ΔY range; §3-StellarState validity; snap-always honesty; route
  shape + 422; an **AST-level** sibling-imports-no-PROVIDER check) plus **1 UNGATED**
  (`/helium_status` is 200 with a `has_grid` bool even with no data — the data-availability
  visibility gate, the one test exercised on every checkout). The POSYDON
  CO-HMS_RLO compact-object sibling (`test_posydon_co.py`,
  gated `requires_posydon_co_data`) has **24** — Chunk 1a's 18 (snap/parse honesty, whole-grid
  no-NaN/no-dupe, per-step StellarState validity, the accretion-cue Eddington-bound regression,
  the Gate-1 CO-mass-growth/RLOF-then-detach regression, route shape + 422/503) plus Chunk 1b's
  **2** (the `/co_binary_track` payload carries a non-null per-step `roche` block; the Gate-1
  Roche reshape/lobe-swap: q sweeps 0.53→1.18 as the star strips and the BH accretes, the star
  fills its lobe on every RLOF1 step) plus Chunk 1c's **3** (gated `requires_posydon_co_multifeh`:
  `available_feh` reflects the real baked bucket set; the metallicity axis is real — the same
  (M_star, M_co, P) request snaps to a different real track / outcome across [Fe/H] buckets; and
  the served-level regression that the η·Ṁ·c² accretion cue is `None` on POSYDON `unstable_MT`
  tracks — the gate that keeps the metal-poor 505,221×-Eddington artifact off the caption) plus the
  **Chunk-1c advisor follow-up's 2** (`test_accretion_cue_is_none_on_wd_companion_tracks`: the cue is
  `None` on WD-companion tracks too — η=0.1 is a NS/BH efficiency, ~2–3 dex too deep for a WD;
  `test_served_accretion_cue_is_bounded_and_only_in_regime`: the ≤5× bound asserted on the SERVED
  `accretion_lum_lsun` from a sampled cue-bearing population, not recomputed over raw columns — so the
  test-gate and production-gate can't silently diverge). The Chunk-1a Eddington-bound test was updated
  to mirror the now THREE-part gate (not-detached AND not-unstable_MT AND not-WD, ceiling tightened
  10→5×). The POSYDON **CO-HeMS / CO-HeMS_RLO** double-compact-object sibling (Chunk 2a — the
  He-star twins of CO-HMS_RLO, `posydon_co.py` parameterized by a `kind` arg over
  `baked_co_hems`/`baked_co_hems_rlo`) adds `test_posydon_co_he.py` (**44**, gated
  `requires_posydon_co_he_data`): 4 UNGATED pure `dco_classification` unit tests
  (BH+BH/NS+BH/NS+NS labels, WD/None → no DCO, nan-mass); parametrized-over-kind snap/parse
  honesty, whole-grid no-NaN/no-dupe, per-step StellarState + H-stripped-surface validity; the
  He-donor (Case BB/BC) accretion regression + the detached-`no_MT`-cue-stays-None + unresolved-
  companion graceful-degradation locks; the **DCO POSITIVE-presence regression** (assert
  `dco is not None` + label — the optional SN-scalar load must not silently degrade); the
  **re-derived Eddington bound** across all 8 [Fe/H] buckets of both He grids (raw + served-level,
  measured **≤3.65×** — co-hems-rlo at feh=−4.0, co-hems uniform 3.47× — the He grids CLEANER than
  CO-HMS_RLO with zero ungated >5× rows); the `kind` axis + the one-letter `co-hms-rlo`/`co-hems-rlo`
  hazard guard; route shape + 422 (incl. unknown kind); **plus Chunk 2c's +6** (gated
  `requires_posydon_co_he_multifeh`, ×2 He kinds): `available_feh` reflects the real baked bucket set
  per kind, the metallicity axis is real via the EVOLVED-track fingerprint (co-hems final He-star mass
  falls 16.46→8.42 M☉ across the axis — POSYDON reuses the same initial grid per Z, so the signal is
  the evolved track not a distinct node), and the DCO classifier degrades honestly over a whole
  metal-poor grid. The POSYDON co-evolved-binary sibling
  (path (b) Chunk 4a) adds
  **19** tests (`test_posydon.py`, gated `requires_posydon_data`): snap honesty (a
  request lands on a true (M1,q,P) grid node, never interpolated, verified via an
  exact-node round-trip over a 300-track sample), no duplicate grid nodes and no
  non-finite values across the WHOLE baked grid (an advisor-flagged check — the multi-
  rerun grid could in principle serve a superseded track, or a CE/disruption row could
  emit NaN into the JSON payload; both measured clean), decimation preserving the RLOF
  episode on capped tracks (`BAKE_VERSION` 2 force-keeps RLOF/contact rows on top of the
  uniform stride), both stars' valid `StellarState`s at every step, `mass_init_msun`
  constant vs the current-mass routing scalar, the Gate-0 regression (mass-ordering
  crossing, orbit widening, a real detached→RLOF1→detached sequence, the "stripped +
  companion" outcome) through the real runtime, merger-track graceful degradation, and
  the `/binary_track` + `/binary_track_meta` routes (snap-always + 422 on structurally
  invalid input). The binary path-(b) Chunk-3 Roche geometry adds **8** tests in
  `test_binary.py` (P_init parse, snap↔geometry consistency, donor-heavier-at-RLOF,
  Kepler separation ≈43.7 R☉, L-point ordering, lobes-kiss-at-L1 + donor-bigger + no-leak,
  Eggleton fill, and the route carrying `roche` + the companion fitting its lobe); Chunk 4b's
  `track_roche_geometry` adds **4 more** there (duck-typed synthetic steps: matches the
  single-node engine at the same params, donor/companion lobe sizes swap across a synthetic
  reversal, `None` on a degenerate step) plus **2** in `test_posydon.py` (the Gate-0 track's
  real lobes reshape + swap dominance; the `/binary_track` route carries a non-null `roche`
  block on every step).
  The binary-stripped-star spectrum sibling (Chunk 3) adds **7**
  tests (`test_stripped_spectra.py`, gated `requires_stripped_spectra_data`): the flat-node
  snap honesty + state↔spectrum consistency, the absorption→emission sequence as a
  regression (He II 4686 flat at the subdwarf end → strong emission at the He-star end),
  the continuum-normalized shape, and the `/stripped_spectrum` route (snap-always + 422).
  The §10 anchors are the regression gate (Sun: L≈1.07,
  Teff≈5834 K at 4.6 Gyr). The rotating axis now has its own within-bucket [Fe/H]
  interpolation tests (lies-between + held-out accuracy at vvcrit=0.4), mirroring the
  non-rotating ones — gated by `requires_mist_rotation_multifeh` /
  `requires_mist_rotation_heldout_feh`. The mass-loss-rate (`Mdot`) threading for the
  SED wind tail adds 4 §10 tests (present & ≤0; grows MS→AGB and up the OB sequence;
  carried through the feh-blend, lies-between & ≤0). The SN sibling has **20** tests
  (`test_supernova.py`): Chunk 1's Tier-1 ⁵⁶Co slope on the served `L_radio` component, the
  Tier-3 M_Ni-scales-the-tail linearity, the plateau⊕tail handoff, the no-plateau
  fallback, the NS/BH split, the SN-branch-only progenitor scalars, and the `/supernova`
  route (SN payload + non-SN honest-empty + 422); plus **Chunk 5's +5**: the fallback BH
  (remnant grows past the proto-NS, still erupts), the remnant/ejecta **continuity across the
  old CO=7 cut** (no cliff), the monotone fallback gradient, the **failed/direct-collapse**
  branch (M_ej<M_EJ_FAIL, ejected Ni→0, no plateau, faint-positive curve, non-expanding R₀
  photosphere), and Tier-3 linearity surviving the fallback dimming. Light-curve physics is
  unit-tested deterministically; the endgame→sibling→route path through the real provider.
  The real interior-structure sibling adds **17** tests (`test_structure.py`, gated by
  `requires_structure_data`): convective-envelope-over-radiative-core, order-of-SSM central
  values, monotone centrally-concentrated ρ, r/R spanning [0,1], canonical-polytrope overlay
  (n=3 more concentrated than n=1.5), honest age/mass snapping, and the `/structure` route +
  422s; plus **4 flip tests** for the 2/6/15 M☉ slices (gated by `requires_structure_massive`, a
  ≥4 M☉ slice so they *skip* not fail on a 1 M☉-only checkout): the 6 M☉ convective-core +
  n=3/2 + radiative-envelope-at-r/R=0.9, the direct Sun↔6 M☉ *mirror* on the same two probe
  radii, the 2 M☉ core-convective check, and the 15 M☉ SN-progenitor deepest-convective-core
  (core r/R 0→0.178, hotter/less-dense than 6 M☉); plus the **25 M☉ upper-SN-range** test and
  the **2 low-mass M-dwarf** tests (`requires_structure_lowmass`); plus **two metallicity-axis
  trend tests** (`requires_structure_multifeh`, gated on |[Fe/H]|>0.3), one at **1 M☉** and one
  at **0.8 M☉** (the second mass on the Z axis — the partial 2D grid): the matched-Xc monotone
  envelope-shallowing base(+0.5)<base(0)<base(−1), all `expected_n`=3 (not a core flip). The 0.8 M☉
  one reuses a mass-parametrized `_midms_envelope_base`.

### Next
- **`docs/plans/ROADMAP.md`** is the canonical cross-plan index of everything
  proposed-but-unbuilt (SED Chunk 2, WR/WD endgame Chunks 4–7, the
  rotation/subpopulation atlas, spectra-density stragglers). Update it (not a second
  list) when scope changes. [[star-sim-rotation-subpop-atlas]].

## Conventions

- Keep the stub honest: it is physically *flavored*, not a model. Label
  approximations in comments (the corona/activity layer is "evocative, not
  predictive" per spec §7).
- Don't let scope creep in: no live structure solve, no nuclear network, no
  deploy/bundle concerns (spec §2). This runs locally.
- **Claude's auto-memory is tracked in the repo** at `docs/memory/` (`MEMORY.md`
  index + one file per fact). The harness still reads/writes memory from its fixed
  path `~/.claude/projects/M--claud-projects-star-sim/memory`, which is a **directory
  junction** pointing at `docs/memory/` — so every memory write lands in the repo.
  Consequence: after writing or editing memory, **`git add docs/memory` and commit
  it** like any other tracked change (the session-end ritual already covers this). If
  the junction is ever missing (fresh clone on another machine, or it got replaced by
  a real dir), re-create it: `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "<that .claude path>"
  -Target "<repo>\docs\memory"` (Windows; no admin needed) — the repo copy is the
  source of truth.
